- en: How did I come to write a scripting book? It's a strange tale. It seems that
    a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what better way to do
    that than to read a good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a tutorial
    and reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking for a book that
    would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating
    detail, with well-commented examples. [[1]](#FTN.AEN21281) In fact, I was looking
    for *this very book*, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, [it didn't
    exist](biblio.html#KOCHANREF), and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so,
    here we are, folks.

  zh: 我是如何开始写脚本编程书的？这是一个奇怪的故事。似乎几年前我需要学习shell脚本编程——还有什么比读一本关于这个主题的好书更好的方法呢？我正在寻找一本涵盖该主题所有方面的教程和参考书。我正在寻找一本能够将复杂的概念彻底解释清楚，并以详尽的细节、带有良好注释的例子进行解释的书。[1](#FTN.AEN21281)
    实际上，我正在寻找的就是这本书，或者非常类似的书。不幸的是，[它并不存在](biblio.html#KOCHANREF)，如果我想得到它，我就必须自己写。所以，我们就到了这里，朋友们。
- en: That reminds me of the apocryphal story about a mad professor. Crazy as a loon,
    the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the library, at a bookstore,
    anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have
    written it, should have written it -- and done a better job of it to boot. He
    would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that, write a book with the very
    same title. When he died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books
    to his credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have
    been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow who lived
    his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by it . . . and somehow I can't
    help admiring the old coot.

  zh: 这让我想起了关于一个疯狂教授的轶事。这家伙疯狂得像只疯鹅。一看到书，无论是什么书——在图书馆、书店，还是任何地方——他都会完全痴迷于自己能写这本书，应该写这本书——并且写得更好。于是他会急忙回家，着手写一本具有相同标题的书。几年后他去世时，据说他拥有几千本书，可能连阿西莫夫都感到羞愧。这些书可能并不怎么样，谁知道呢，但这真的重要吗？这是一个实现了自己梦想的人，即使他为此着迷，被它驱使……而且我忍不住要钦佩这位老先生。
