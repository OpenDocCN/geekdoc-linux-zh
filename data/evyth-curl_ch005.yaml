  zh: 它是如何开始的
- en: Back in 1996, [Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/) was writing an IRC
    bot in his spare time, an automated program that would offer services for the
    participants in a chatroom dedicated to the Amiga computer (#amiga on the IRC
    network EFnet). He came to think that it would be fun to get some updated currency
    rates and have his bot offer a service online for the chat room users to get current
    exchange rates, to ask the bot “please exchange 200 USD into SEK” or similar.

  zh: 回到1996年，[Daniel Stenberg](https://daniel.haxx.se/)在业余时间编写了一个IRC机器人，这是一个自动化的程序，将为专门用于Amiga计算机的聊天室（EFnet网络上的#amiga）的参与者提供服务。他开始想，获取一些更新的货币汇率并让他的机器人为聊天室用户提供在线服务以获取当前汇率，比如询问机器人“请将200美元兑换成SEK”或类似的内容，会很有趣。
- en: In order to have the provided exchange rates as accurate as possible, the bot
    would download the rates daily from a website that was hosting them. A small tool
    to download data over HTTP was needed for this task. A quick look-around at the
    time had Daniel find a tiny tool named httpget (written by the Brazilian developer
    Rafael Sagula). It did the job, almost, just needed a few little tweaks here and
    there.

  zh: 为了使提供的汇率尽可能准确，机器人需要每天从托管这些汇率的一个网站上下载汇率。为此任务需要一个下载HTTP数据的工具。当时快速搜索了一下，Daniel发现了一个名为httpget的小工具（由巴西开发者Rafael
    Sagula编写）。它几乎完成了任务，只是需要在这里和那里做一些小小的调整。
- en: Rafael released HttpGet 0.1 on November 11, 1996 and already in the next release,
    called 0.2 released in December that year, Daniel had his first changes included.
    Soon after that, Daniel had taken over maintenance of the few hundred lines of
    code it was.

  zh: Rafael于1996年11月11日发布了HttpGet 0.1版本，在次年的12月，也就是0.2版本发布时，Daniel首次对其进行了修改。不久之后，Daniel接管了那几百行代码的维护工作。
- en: HttpGet 1.0 was released on April 8 1997 with brand new HTTP proxy support.

  zh: HttpGet 1.0于1997年4月8日发布，新增了全新的HTTP代理支持。
- en: We soon found and fixed support for getting currencies over GOPHER. Once FTP
    download support was added, the name of the project was changed and urlget 2.0
    was released in August 1997\. The HTTP-only days were already past.

  zh: 我们很快找到了并修复了通过GOPHER获取货币的支持。一旦添加了FTP下载支持，项目名称也发生了变化，urlget 2.0于1997年8月发布。HTTP-only的时代已经过去了。
- en: The project slowly grew bigger. When upload capabilities were added and the
    name once again was misleading, a second name change was made and on March 20,
    1998 curl 4 was released. (The version numbering from the previous names was kept.)

  zh: 项目逐渐变得更大。当添加了上传功能，并且名称再次具有误导性时，项目名称再次发生了变化，于1998年3月20日发布了curl 4版本。（保留了之前名称的版本编号。）
- en: We consider **March 20 1998** to be curl’s birthday.
