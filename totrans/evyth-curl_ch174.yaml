    a number of request headers. That is a set of `name: value` pairs that ends with
    a blank line that separates the headers from the following request body (that
    sometimes is empty).'

    like for example `Host:`, `Accept:`, `User-Agent:` and a few others that may depend
    on what the user asks curl to do.

- en: All headers set by curl itself can be replaced, by the user. You just then tell
    curl’s `-H` or `--header` the new header to use and it then replaces the internal
    one if the header field matches one of those headers, or it adds the specified
    header to the list of headers to send in the request.
