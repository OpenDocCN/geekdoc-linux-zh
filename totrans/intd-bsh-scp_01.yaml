    directly in your terminal, and also, you can use Bash like any other programming
    language to write scripts. This book will help you learn the basics of Bash scripting
    including Bash Variables, User Input, Comments, Arguments, Arrays, Conditional
    Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Debugging, and testing.

- en: Bash scripts are great for automating repetitive workloads and can help you
    save time considerably. For example, imagine working with a group of five developers
    on a project that requires a tedious environment setup. In order for the program
    to work correctly, each developer has to manually set up the environment. That's
    the same and very long task (setting up the environment) repeated five times at
    least. This is where you and Bash scripts come to the rescue! So instead, you
    create a simple text file containing all the necessary instructions and share
    it with your teammates. And now, all they have to do is execute the Bash script
    and everything will be created for them.

    like Sublime Text, VS Code, or a terminal-based editor like vim or nano.
