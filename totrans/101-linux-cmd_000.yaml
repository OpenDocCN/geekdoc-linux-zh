- en: My name is Bobby Iliev, and I have been working as a Linux DevOps Engineer since
    2014\. I am an avid Linux lover and supporter of the open-source movement philosophy.
    I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it,
    and I believe in sharing knowledge.

    good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. You have to perform at a consistently
    higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.
