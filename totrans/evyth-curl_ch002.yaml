- en: '*Everything curl* is an extensive guide for all things curl. The project, the
    command-line tool, the library, how everything started and how it came to be the
    useful tool it is today. It explains how we work on developing it further, what
    it takes to use it, how you can contribute with code or bug reports and why millions
    of existing users use it.'

    at some point consider it fairly complete, covering most aspects of the project
    (even if only that seems like an insurmountable goal), the curl project will continue
    to move so there will always be things to update in the book as well.
