    in thousands of tools, services and applications out there today, performing their
    Internet data transfers.

- en: libcurl is a library of functions that are provided with a C API, for applications
    written in C. You can easily use it from C++ too, with only a few considerations
    (see [libcurl for C++ programmers](ch199.xhtml#libcurl__cplusplus__md)). For other
    languages, there exist *bindings* that work as intermediate layers between libcurl
    the library and corresponding functions for the particular language you like.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have designed libcurl to be transfer oriented usually without forcing users
    to be protocol experts or in fact know much at all about networking or the protocols
    involved. You setup a transfer with as many details and specific information as
    you can and want, and then you tell libcurl to perform that transfer.

- en: That said, networking and protocols are areas with lots of pitfalls and special
    cases so the more you know about these things, the more you are able to understand
    about libcurl’s options and ways of working. Not to mention, such knowledge is
    invaluable when you are debugging and need to understand what to do next when
    things do not go as you intended.

- en: The most basic libcurl using application can be as small as just a couple of
    lines of code, but most applications do, of course, need more code than that.

- en: Simple by default, more on demand
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: libcurl generally does the simple and basic transfer by default, and if you
    want to add more advanced features, you add that by setting the correct options.
    For example, libcurl does not support HTTP cookies by default but it does once
    you tell it.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This makes libcurl’s behaviors easier to guess and depend on, and also it makes
    it easier to maintain old behavior and add new features. Only applications that
    actually ask for and use the new features get that behavior.
