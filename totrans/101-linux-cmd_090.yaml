    all the lines. Action print without any argument prints the whole line by default,
    so it prints all the lines of the file without failure.

- en: 'NR: NR command keeps a current count of the number of input records. Remember
    that records are usually lines. Awk command performs the pattern/action statements
    once for each record in a file. NF: NF command keeps a count of the number of
    fields within the current input record. FS: FS command contains the field separator
    character which is used to divide fields on the input line. The default is “white
    space”, meaning space and tab characters. FS can be reassigned to another character
    (typically in BEGIN) to change the field separator. RS: RS command stores the
    current record separator character. Since, by default, an input line is the input
    record, the default record separator character is a newline. OFS: OFS command
    stores the output field separator, which separates the fields when Awk prints
    them. The default is a blank space. Whenever print has several parameters separated
    with commas, it will print the value of OFS in between each parameter. ORS: ORS
    command stores the output record separator, which separates the output lines when
    Awk prints them. The default is a newline character. print automatically outputs
    the contents of ORS at the end of whatever it is given to print.'
