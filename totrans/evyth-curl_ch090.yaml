- en: When you invoke curl from a shell or some other command-line prompt system,
    that environment generally provides you with a set of output redirection abilities.
    In most Linux and Unix shells and with Windows’ command prompts, you direct stdout
    to a file with `> filename`. Using this, of course, makes the use of -o or -O
    superfluous.

- en: Redirecting output to a file redirects all output from curl to that file, so
    even if you ask to transfer more than one URL to stdout, redirecting the output
    gets all the URLs’ output stored in that single file.

- en: 'Unix shells usually allow you to redirect the *stderr* stream separately. The
    stderr stream is usually a stream that also gets shown in the terminal, but you
    can redirect it separately from the stdout stream. The stdout stream is for the
    data while stderr is metadata and errors, etc., that are not data. You can redirect
    stderr with `2>file` like this:'
