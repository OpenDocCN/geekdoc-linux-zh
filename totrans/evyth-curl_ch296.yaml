- en: All internals need to be written non-blocking and cannot just hang around and
    wait for things to occur. At the same time, the multi interface allows users to
    call libcurl to perform virtually at any time, even if no action has happened
    or a timeout has triggered.

- en: In the external API libcurl provides a single timeout at a time, no matter how
    many concurrent transfers and what options are set. An application can get the
    timeout value it with `curl_multi_timeout()` or in a `CURLMOPT_TIMERFUNCTION`
    callback, depending on what API it wants to use.

- en: Every easy handle keeps an array of timeouts, in a sorted order. The closest
    (next-timeout) in time is first in the list.

- en: All easy handles are put in a *splay tree* which is binary self-balancing search
    tree that makes it fast to insert and remove nodes depending on their timeouts.

- en: The internal function for *setting* a timeout is called `Curl_expire()`. It
    asks that libcurl gets called again for this handle in a certain amount of milliseconds
    into the future. A timeout is set with a specific ID, to make sure that it overrides
    previous values set for the same timeout etc. The existing timeout IDs are limited
    and the set is hard-coded.

- en: A timeout can be removed again with `Curl_expire_clear()`, which then removes
    that timeout from the list of timeouts for the given easy handle.

- en: Expired timeouts
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Expiration of a timeout means that the application knows that it needs to call
    libcurl again. When the *socket_action* API is used, it even knows to call libcurl
    again for a specific given easy handle for which the timeout has expired.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is no other special action or activity happening when a timeout expires
    than that the perform function is called. Each state or internal function needs
    to know what times or states to check for and act accordingly when called (again).
