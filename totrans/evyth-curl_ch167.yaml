    and [multipart formpost](ch165.xhtml#http__post__multipart__md), and in your typical
    command lines you do them with `-d` or `-F`.

- en: As described in the chapters mentioned above, both these options send the specified
    data to the server. The difference is in how the data is formatted over the wire.
    Most of the time, the receiving end is written to expect a specific format and
    it expects that the sender formats and sends the data correctly. A client cannot
    just pick a format of its own choice.

- en: When we are talking browsers and HTML, the standard way is to offer a form to
    the user that sends off data when the form has been filled in. The `<form>` tag
    is what makes one of those appear on the webpage. The tag instructs the browser
    how to format its POST. If the form tag includes `enctype=multipart/form-data`,
    it tells the browser to send the data as a [multipart formpost](ch165.xhtml#http__post__multipart__md)
    which you make with curl’s `-F` option. This method is typically used when the
    form includes a `<input type=file>` tag, for file uploads.

- en: The default `enctype` used by forms, which is rarely spelled out in HTML since
    it is default, is `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. It makes the browser URL
    encode the input as name=value pairs with the data encoded to avoid unsafe characters.
    We often refer to that as a [regular POST](ch154.xhtml#http__post__simple__md),
    and you perform one with curl’s `-d` and friends.

- en: POST is a regular HTTP method and there is no requirement that it be triggered
    by HTML or involve a browser. Lots of services, APIs and other systems allow you
    to pass in data these days in order to get things done.

- en: If these services expect plain raw data or perhaps data formatted as JSON or
    similar, you want the [regular POST](ch154.xhtml#http__post__simple__md) approach.
    curl’s `-d` option does not alter or encode the data at all but just sends exactly
    what you tell it to. Just pay attention that `-d` sets a default `Content-Type:`
    that might not be what you want.
