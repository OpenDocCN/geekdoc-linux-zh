- en: Note that this way of authentication is different than the otherwise widely
    used scheme on the web today where authentication is performed by an HTTP POST
    and then keeping state in cookies. See [Cookies with libcurl](ch250.xhtml#libcurl-http__cookies__md)
    for details on how to do that.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A client does not itself decide that it wants to send an authenticated request.
    It is something the server requires. When the server has a resource that is protected
    and requires authentication, it responds with a 401 HTTP response and a `WWW-Authenticate:`
    header. The header includes details about what specific authentication methods
    it accepts for that resource.

- en: Basic
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Basic is the default HTTP authentication method and as its name suggests, it
    is indeed basic. It takes the name and the password, separates them with a colon
    and base64 encodes that string before it puts the entire thing into a `Authorization:`
    HTTP header in the request.

  prefs:

- en: Another HTTP authentication method is called Digest. One advantage this method
    has compared to Basic, is that it does not send the password over the wire in
    plain text. This is however an authentication method that is rarely spoken by
    browsers and consequently is not a frequently used one.

- en: Some HTTP servers allow one out of several authentication methods, in some cases
    you find yourself in a position where you as a client does not want or is not
    able to select a single specific method before-hand and for yet another subset
    of cases your application does not know if the requested URL even require authentication
    or not.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: libcurl covers all these situations as well.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can ask libcurl to use more than one method, and when doing so, you imply
    that curl first tries the request without any authentication at all and then based
    on the HTTP response coming back, it selects one of the methods that both the
    server and your application allow. If more than one would work, curl picks them
    in a order based on how secure the methods are considered to be, picking the safest
    of the available methods.

    to probe first to check if it can possibly still make the request without the
    use of authentication, you can force that behavior by adding `CURLAUTH_ONLY` to
    the bitmask.
