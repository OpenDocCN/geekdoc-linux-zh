- en: The header struct pointer the header API functions return, points to memory
    associated with the easy handle and subsequent calls to the functions clobber
    that struct. Applications need to copy the data if they want to keep it around.
    The memory used for the struct gets freed with calling `curl_easy_cleanup()`.
