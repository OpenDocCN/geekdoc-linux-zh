- en: curl supports HTTP/2 for both HTTP:// and HTTPS:// URLs assuming that curl was
    built with the proper prerequisites. It even defaults to using HTTP/2 when given
    an HTTPS URL since doing so implies no penalty and when curl is used with sites
    that do not support HTTP/2 the request instead negotiates HTTP/1.1.

- en: With HTTP:// URLs however, the upgrade to HTTP/2 is done with an `Upgrade:`
    header that may cause an extra round-trip and perhaps even more troublesome, a
    sizable share of old servers returns a 400 response when seeing such a header.

- en: It should also be noted that some (most?) servers that support HTTP/2 for `HTTP://`
    (which in itself is not all servers) do not acknowledge the `Upgrade:` header
    on POST, for example.

- en: If your curl does not support HTTP/2, that command line tool returns an error
    saying so. Running `curl -V` shows if your version of curl supports it.

- en: If you by some chance already know that your server speaks HTTP/2 (for example,
    within your own controlled environment where you know exactly what runs in your
    machines) you can shortcut the HTTP/2 negotiation with `--http2-prior-knowledge`.

- en: A primary feature in the HTTP/2 protocol, is the ability to multiplex several
    logical streams over the same physical connection. The curl command-line tool
    can take advantage of this feature when [doing parallel transfers](ch066.xhtml#cmdline__urls__parallel__md).
