    than you access the resources and the data otherwise protected.

    pass them on or use them to something else.

- en: 'The most basic curl authentication option is `-u / --user`. It accepts an argument
    that is the username and password, colon separated. Like when `alice` wants to
    request a page requiring HTTP authentication and her password is `12345`:'

- en: Several potentially bad things are going on here. First, we are entering a password
    on the command line and the command line might be readable for other users on
    the same system (assuming you have a multi-user system). curl helps minimize that
    risk by trying to blank out passwords from process listings.

- en: One way to avoid passing the username and password on the command line is to
    instead use a [.netrc file](ch109.xhtml#usingcurl__netrc__md) or a [config file](ch070.xhtml#cmdline__configfile__md).
    You can also use the `-u` option without specifying the password, and then curl
    instead prompts the user for it when it runs.

- en: Secondly, this command line sends the user credentials to an HTTP server, which
    is a clear-text protocol that is open for man-in-the-middle or other snoopers
    to spy on the connection and see what is sent. In this command line example, it
    makes curl use HTTP Basic authentication and that is completely insecure.

- en: There are several ways to avoid this, and the key is, of course, then to avoid
    protocols or authentication schemes that send credentials in plain text over the
    network. Easiest is perhaps to make sure you use encrypted versions of protocols.
    Use HTTPS instead of HTTP, use FTPS instead of FTP and so on.

- en: If you need to stick to a plain text and insecure protocol, then see if you
    can switch to using an authentication method that avoids sending the credentials
    in the clear. If you want HTTP, such methods would include Digest (`--digest`),
    Negotiate (`--negotiate.`) and NTLM (`--ntlm`).
