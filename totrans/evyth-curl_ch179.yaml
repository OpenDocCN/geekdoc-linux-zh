- en: Netscape once created a file format for storing cookies on disk so that they
    would survive browser restarts. curl adopted that file format to allow sharing
    the cookies with browsers, only to soon watch the browsers move away from that
    format. Modern browsers no longer use it, while curl still does.

- en: The Netscape cookie file format stores one cookie per physical line in the file
    with a bunch of associated meta data, each field separated with TAB. That file
    is called the cookiejar in curl terminology.

- en: When libcurl saves a cookiejar, it creates a file header of its own in which
    there is a URL mention that links to the web version of this document.
