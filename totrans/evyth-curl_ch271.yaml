- en: WebSocket is an **EXPERIMENTAL** feature present in libcurl 7.86.0 and later.
    Since it is experimental, you need to explicitly enable it in the build for it
    to be present and available.

- en: To figure out if your libcurl installation supports WebSocket, you can call
    [`curl_version_info()`](ch192.xhtml#libcurl__api__md) and check the `->protocols`
    fields in the returned struct. It should contain `ws` for it to be present, and
    probably also `wss`.
