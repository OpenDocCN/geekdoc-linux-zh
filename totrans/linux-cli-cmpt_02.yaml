    files and directories, how to install programs and so on. You should also be already
    comfortable with programming basics like variables, loops and functions.

- en: In terms of software, you should have access to the `GNU bash` shell and commonly
    used Linux command line tools. This could be as part of a Linux distribution or
    via other means such as a Virtual Machine, WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) and
    so on. More details about the expected working environment will be discussed in
    the introductory chapters.

- en: You are also expected to get comfortable with reading manuals, searching online,
    visiting external links provided for further reading, tinkering with the illustrated
    examples, asking for help when you are stuck and so on. In other words, be proactive
    and curious instead of just consuming the content passively.

    It could be anything from a simple thank you, pointing out a typo, mistakes in
    code snippets, which aspects of the book worked for you (or didn't!) and so on.
    Reader feedback is essential and especially so for self-published authors.

- en: Sundeep Agarwal is a lazy being who prefers to work just enough to support his
    modest lifestyle. He accumulated vast wealth working as a Design Engineer at Analog
    Devices and retired from the corporate world at the ripe age of twenty-eight.
    Unfortunately, he squandered his savings within a few years and had to scramble
    trying to earn a living. Against all odds, selling programming ebooks saved his
    lazy self from having to look for a job again. He can now afford all the fantasy
    ebooks he wants to read and spends unhealthy amount of time browsing the internet.

- en: When the creative muse strikes, he can be found working on yet another programming
    ebook (which invariably ends up having at least one example with regular expressions).
    Researching materials for his ebooks and everyday social media usage drowned his
    bookmarks, so he maintains curated resource lists for sanity sake. He is thankful
    for free learning resources and open source tools. His own contributions can be
    found at [https://github.com/learnbyexample](https://github.com/learnbyexample).
