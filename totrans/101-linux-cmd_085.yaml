- en: The `ping` (Packet Internet Groper) command is a network utility used to check
    network connectivity between a host and a server or another host. It sends ICMP
    (Internet Control Message Protocol) echo requests to a specified IP address or
    URL and measures the time it takes to receive a response. This time delay is referred
    to as "latency." Ping is a fundamental tool for network troubleshooting and monitoring.

    of packets to the target host and calculating the time it takes for each packet
    to complete the round trip. The latency is typically measured in milliseconds
