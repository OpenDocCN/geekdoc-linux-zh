- en: HTTP is a protocol that is easy to learn the basics of. A client connects to
    a server—and it is always the client that takes the initiative—sends a request
    and receives a response. Both the request and the response consist of headers
    and a body. There can be little or a lot of information going in both directions.

- en: An HTTP request sent by a client starts with a request line, followed by headers
    and then optionally a body. The most common HTTP request is probably the GET request
    which asks the server to return a specific resource, and this request does not
    contain a body.
