- en: this host has `getaddrinfo()` and family, and thus we use that. The host may
    not be able to resolve IPv6, but we do not really have to take that into account.
    Hosts that are not IPv6-enabled have `CURLRES_IPV4` defined.

    The name resolve is done in a new thread, and the supported asynch API is be the
    same as for ares-builds. This is the default under (native) Windows.

    libcurl is not built to use an asynchronous resolver, `CURLRES_SYNCH` is defined.
