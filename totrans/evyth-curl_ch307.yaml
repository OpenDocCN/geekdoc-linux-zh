- en: When we speak of *debug builds*, we usually refer to curl builds that are done
    with debug code and symbols still present. We strongly recommend you do this if
    you want to work with curl development as it makes it easier to test and debug.

- en: Debug-builds make it possible to run individual test cases with gdb with runtests.pl,
    which is handy - especially for example if you can make it crash somewhere as
    then gdb can catch it and show you exactly where it happens etc.

- en: Debug-builds are also built a little different than regular *release builds*
    in that they contain some snippets of code that makes curl easier to test. For
    example it allows the test suite to override the random number generator so that
    testing for values that otherwise are random actually work. Also, the unit tests
    only work on debug builds.

    system.

- en: When switched on, the memdebug system outputs detailed information about a lot
    of memory-related options into a logfile, so that it can be analyzed and verified
    after the fact. Verified that all memory was freed, all files were closed and
    so on.

    features. It is however fairly portable and low-impact.

- en: In a debug build, the memdebug system is enabled by curl if the `CURL_MEMDEBUG`
    environment variable is set to a filename, which is used for the log. The test
    suite sets this variable for us (see `tests/log/memdump`) and verifies it after
    each test run, if present.
