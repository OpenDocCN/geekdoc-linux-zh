- en: This command-line option only changes the text in the outgoing request, it does
    not change any behavior. This is particularly important if you, for example, ask
    curl to send a HEAD with `-X`, as HEAD is specified to send all the headers a
    GET response would get but *never* send a response body, even if the headers otherwise
    imply that one would come. So, adding `-X HEAD` to a command line that would otherwise
    do a GET causes curl to hang, waiting for a response body that does not come.

- en: When asking curl to perform HTTP transfers, it picks the correct method based
    on the option so you should only rarely have to explicitly ask for it with `-X`.
    It should also be noted that when curl follows redirects like asked to with `-L`,
    the request method set with `-X` is sent even on the subsequent redirects.
