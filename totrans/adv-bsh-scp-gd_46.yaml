    or Apple systems. The endarkened execs and the arachnoid corporate attorneys of
    those particular outfits have been using litigation in a predatory manner and/or
    as a weapon against the Open Source Community. Any Solaris or Apple users needing
    scripting help will therefore kindly direct their concerns to corporate customer
    service.
