    for each protocol, and several protocols may even allow different ways of uploading
    data.

- en: HTTP, and its bigger brother HTTPS, offer several different ways to upload data
    to a server, and curl provides easy command-line options to do it the three most
    common ways, described below.

    the same operation and in fact many downloads are initiated with an HTTP POST.

- en: POST is the HTTP method that was invented to send data to a receiving web application,
    and it is, for example, how most common HTML forms on the web work. It usually
    sends a chunk of relatively small amounts of data to the receiver.

    are a few additional alterations.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Multipart formposts are also used in HTML forms on websites; typically when
    there is a file upload involved. This type of upload is also an HTTP POST but
    it sends the data formatted according to some special rules, which is what the
    multipart name means.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since it sends the data formatted completely differently, you cannot select
    which type of POST to use at your own whim but it entirely depends on what the
    receiving server end expects and can handle.

    meant to be put as-is on the remote site or even replace an existing resource
    there. That said, this is also the least used upload method for HTTP on the web
    today and lots, if not most, web servers do not even have PUT enabled.

    upload the mail body to the SMTP server. With SMTP, you also need to include all
    the mail headers you need (`To:`, `From:`, `Date:`, etc.) in the mail body as
    curl does not add any at all.

- en: The general progress meter curl provides (see the [Progress meter](ch073.xhtml#cmdline__progressmeter__md)
    section) works fine for uploads as well. What needs to be remembered is that the
    progress meter is automatically disabled when you are sending output to stdout,
    and most protocols curl support can output something even for an upload.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Therefore, you may need to explicitly redirect the downloaded data to a file
    (using shell redirect ‘>’, `-o` or similar) to get the progress meter displayed
    for upload.
