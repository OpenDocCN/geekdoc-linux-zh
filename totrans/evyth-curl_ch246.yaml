- en: Every HTTP request includes an HTTP response. An HTTP response is a set of metadata
    and a response body, where the body can occasionally be zero bytes and thus nonexistent.
    An HTTP response however always has response headers.

    reliable way since not all URLs provide the size up front (like for example for
    servers that generate content on demand) you can instead ask for the amount of
    downloaded data in the most recent transfer.

- en: While the response code numbers can include numbers (in the 4xx and 5xx ranges)
    which the server uses to signal that there was an error processing the request,
    it is important to realize that this does not make libcurl return an error.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When libcurl is asked to perform an HTTP transfer it returns an error if that
    HTTP transfer fails. However, getting an HTTP 404 or the like back is not a problem
    for libcurl. It is not an HTTP transfer error. A user might be writing a client
    for testing a server’s HTTP responses.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you insist on curl treating HTTP response codes from 400 and up as errors,
    libcurl offers the `CURLOPT_FAILONERROR` option that if set instructs curl to
    return `CURLE_HTTP_RETURNED_ERROR` in this case. It then returns error as soon
    as possible and does not deliver the response body.
