<h1 data-number="83">What exactly is downloading?</h1>
<p>You specify the resource to download by giving curl a URL. curl defaults to downloading a URL unless told otherwise, and the URL identifies what to download. In this example the URL to download is <code>http://example.com</code>:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://example.com</code></pre>
<p>The URL is broken down into its individual components (<a href="../../cmdline/urls/">as explained elsewhere</a>), the correct server is contacted and is then asked to deliver the specific resource—often a file. The server then delivers the data, or it refuses or perhaps the client asked for the wrong data and then that data is delivered.</p>
<p>A request for a resource is protocol-specific so an <code>FTP://</code> URL works differently than an <code>HTTP://</code> URL or an <code>SFTP://</code> URL.</p>
<p>A URL without a path part, that is a URL that has a hostname part only (like the <code>http://example.com</code> example above) gets a slash (‘/’) appended to it internally and then that is the resource curl asks for from the server.</p>
<p>If you specify multiple URLs on the command line, curl downloads each URL one by one. It does not start the second transfer until the previous one is complete, etc.</p>
