<h1 data-number="192">API compatibility</h1>
<p>libcurl promises API stability and guarantees that your program written today remains working in the future. We do not break compatibility.</p>
<p>Over time, we add features, new options and new functions to the APIs but we do not change behavior in a non-compatible way or remove functions.</p>
<p>The last time we changed the API in an non-compatible way was for 7.16.0 in 2006 and we plan to never do it again.</p>
<section id="libcurl__api__md-_-_-version-numbers" class="level2" data-number="192.1">
<h2 data-number="192.1">Version numbers</h2>
<p>Curl and libcurl are individually versioned, but they mostly follow each other rather closely.</p>
<p>The version numbering is always built up using the same system:</p>
<pre><code>X.Y.Z</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>X is main version number</li>
<li>Y is release number</li>
<li>Z is patch number</li>
</ul>
</section>
<section id="libcurl__api__md-_-_-bumping-numbers" class="level2" data-number="192.2">
<h2 data-number="192.2">Bumping numbers</h2>
<p>One of these X.Y.Z numbers gets bumped in every new release. The numbers to the right of a bumped number are reset to zero.</p>
<p>The main version number X is bumped when <em>really</em> big, world colliding changes are made. The release number Y is bumped when changes are performed or things/features are added. The patch number Z is bumped when the changes are mere bugfixes.</p>
<p>It means that after a release 1.2.3, we can release 2.0.0 if something really big has been made, 1.3.0 if not that big changes were made or 1.2.4 if mostly bugs were fixed.</p>
<p>Bumping, as in increasing the number with 1, is unconditionally only affecting one of the numbers (and the ones to the right of it are set to zero). 1 becomes 2, 3 becomes 4, 9 becomes 10, 88 becomes 89 and 99 becomes 100. So, after 1.2.9 comes 1.2.10. After 3.99.3, 3.100.0 might come.</p>
<p>All original curl source release archives are named according to the libcurl version (not according to the curl client version that, as said before, might differ).</p>

<section id="libcurl__api__md-_-_-which-libcurl-version" class="level2" data-number="192.3">
<h2 data-number="192.3">Which libcurl version</h2>
<p>As a service to any application that might want to support new libcurl features while still being able to build with older versions, all releases have the libcurl version stored in the <code>curl/curlver.h</code> file using a static numbering scheme that can be used for comparison. The version number is defined as:</p>
<pre><code>#define LIBCURL_VERSION_NUM 0xXXYYZZ</code></pre>
<p>Where <code>XX</code> , <code>YY</code> and <code>ZZ</code> are the main version, release and patch numbers in hexadecimal. All three number fields are always represented using two digits (eight bits each). 1.2.0 would appear as <code>0x010200</code> while version 9.11.7 appears as <code>0x090b07</code>.</p>
<p>This 6-digit hexadecimal number is always a greater number in a more recent release. It makes comparisons with greater than and less than work.</p>
<p>This number is also available as three separate defines: <code>LIBCURL_VERSION_MAJOR</code>, <code>LIBCURL_VERSION_MINOR</code> and <code>LIBCURL_VERSION_PATCH</code>.</p>
<p>These defines are, of course, only suitable to figure out the version number built <em>just now</em> and do not help you figuring out which libcurl version that is used at runtime three years from now.</p>
</section>
<section id="libcurl__api__md-_-_-which-libcurl-version-runs" class="level2" data-number="192.4">
<h2 data-number="192.4">Which libcurl version runs</h2>
<p>To figure out which libcurl version that your application is using <em>right now</em>, <code>curl_version_info()</code> is there for you.</p>
<p>Applications should use this function to judge if things are possible to do or not, instead of using compile-time checks, as dynamic/DLL libraries can be changed independent of applications.</p>
<p>curl_version_info() returns a pointer to a struct with information about version numbers and various features and in the running version of libcurl. You call it by giving it a special age counter so that libcurl knows the age of the libcurl that calls it. The age is a define called <code>CURLVERSION_NOW</code> and is a counter that is increased at irregular intervals throughout the curl development. The age number tells libcurl what struct set it can return.</p>
<p>You call the function like this:</p>
<pre><code>curl_version_info_data *version = curl_version_info( CURLVERSION_NOW );</code></pre>
<p>The data then points to struct that has or at least can have the following layout:</p>
<pre><code>struct {
  CURLversion age;          /* see description below */

  /* when &#39;age&#39; is 0 or higher, the members below also exist: */
