    and from within scripts by countless users over the years.

- en: curl has little will of its own. It tries to please you and your wishes to a
    large extent. It also means that it tries to play with what you give it. If you
    misspell an option, it might do something unintended. If you pass in a slightly
    illegal URL, chances are curl still deals with it and proceeds. It means that
    you can pass in crazy data in some options and you can have curl pass on that
    crazy data in its transfer operation.

- en: This is a design choice, as it allows you to really tweak how curl does its
    protocol communications and you can have curl massage your server implementations
    in the most creative ways.
