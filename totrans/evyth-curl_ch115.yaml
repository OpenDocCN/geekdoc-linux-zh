- en: The default proxy type is HTTP so if you specify a proxy hostname (or IP address)
    without a scheme part (the part that is often written as `http://`) curl goes

- en: curl provides a number of options to set the proxy type instead of using the
    scheme prefix. See the [SOCKS](ch116.xhtml#usingcurl__proxies__socks__md) section.
