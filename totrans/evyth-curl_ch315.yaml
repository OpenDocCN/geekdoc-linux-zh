    it offers a special kind of testing. The tests we call **torture** tests. Do not
    worry, it is not quite as grim as it may sound.

    [valgrind](ch311.xhtml#internals__tests__valgrind__md) when trying this out.

- en: If a single test fails, `runtests.pl` identifies exactly which “round” that
    triggered the problem and by using the `-t` as shown, you can run a command line
    that when invoked *only* fails that particular fallible function.

- en: To make this way of testing a little more practical, the test suite also provides
    a `--shallow` option. This lets the user set a maximum number of fallible functions
    to fail per test case. If there are more invokes to fail than is set with this
    value, the script randomly selects which ones to fail.

- en: As a special feature, as randomizing things in tests can be uncomfortable, the
    script uses a random seed based on year + month, so it remains the same for each
    calendar month. Convenient, as if you rerun the same test with the same `--shallow`
    value it runs the same random tests.
