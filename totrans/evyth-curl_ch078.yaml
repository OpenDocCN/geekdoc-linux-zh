- en: You get the site shown with Firefox’s network tools. You then right-click on
    the specific request you want to repeat in the “Web Developer->Network” tool when
    you see the HTTP traffic, and in the menu that appears you select “Copy as cURL”.
    Like this screenshot below shows. The operation then generates a curl command
    line to your clipboard and you can then paste that into your favorite shell window.
    This feature is available by default in all Firefox installations.

    On the line of the specific resource you are interested in, you right-click with
    the mouse and you select “Copy as cURL” and it generates a command line for you
    in your clipboard. Paste that in a shell to get a curl command line that makes
    the transfer. This feature is available by default in all Chrome and Chromium
    installations. *(Note: Chromium browsers in Windows may generate an incorrect
    command line that is misquoted due to a* [*bug*](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1242803)

    in that development menu and get to see a new console pop up that is similar to
    the development tools of Firefox and Chrome.

- en: These methods all give you a command line to reproduce their HTTP transfers.
    They are often not the perfect solution to your problems. Why? Well mostly because
    these tools are written to rerun the *exact* same request that you copied, while
    you often want to rerun the same logic but not send an exact copy of the same
    cookies and file contents etc.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These tools give you command lines with static and fixed cookie contents to
    send in the request, because that is the contents of the cookies that were sent
    in the browser’s requests. You most likely want to rewrite the command line to
    dynamically adapt to whatever the content is in the cookie that the server told
    you in a previous response. Etc.

- en: The copy as curl functionality is also often notoriously bad at using `-F` and
    instead they provide handcrafted `--data-binary` solutions including the mime
    separator strings etc.
