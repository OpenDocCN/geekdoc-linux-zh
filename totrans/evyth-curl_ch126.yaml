    LDAP has LDAPS, POP3 has POP3S, IMAP has IMAPS and SMTP has SMTPS.

    with curl.

- en: There are two general approaches to do TLS with protocols. One of them is to
    speak TLS already from the first connection handshake while the other is to upgrade
    the connection from plain-text to TLS using protocol specific instructions.

- en: With curl, if you explicitly specify the TLS version of the protocol (the one
    that has a name that ends with an ‘S’ character) in the URL, curl tries to connect
    with TLS from start, while if you specify the non-TLS version in the URL you can
    *usually* upgrade the connection to TLS-based with the `--ssl` option.

- en: The protocols that *can* do `--ssl` all favor that method. Using `--ssl` means
    that curl *attempts* to upgrade the connection to TLS but if that fails, it still
    continues with the transfer using the plain-text version of the protocol. To make
    the `--ssl` option **require** TLS to continue, there is instead the `--ssl-reqd`
    option which makes the transfer fail if curl cannot successfully negotiate TLS.

    that TLS is mandatory and curl returns an error if TLS is not negotiated.
