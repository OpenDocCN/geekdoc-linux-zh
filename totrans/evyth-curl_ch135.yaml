- en: SCP and SFTP are both protocols that are built on top of SSH, a secure and encrypted
    data protocol that is similar to TLS but differs in a few important ways. For
    example, SSH does not use certificates of any sort but instead it uses public
    and private keys. Both SSH and TLS provide strong crypto and secure transfers
    when used correctly.

- en: The SCP protocol is generally considered to be the black sheep of the two since
    it is not portable and usually only works between Unix systems.

- en: When requesting a file from an SFTP or SCP URL, the file path given is considered
    to be the absolute path on the remote server unless you specifically ask for the
    path relative to the user’s home directory. You do that by making sure the path
    starts with `/~/`. This is quite the opposite to how FTP URLs work and is a common
    cause for confusion among users.

  prefs:

- en: A secure network client needs to make sure that the remote host is exactly the
    host that it thinks it is communicating with. With TLS based protocols, it is
    done by the client verifying the server’s certificate.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With SSH protocols there are no server certificates, but instead each server
    can provide its unique key. Unlike TLS, SSH has no certificate authorities or
    anything so the client simply has to make sure that the host’s key matches what
    it already knows (via other means) it should look like.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The matching of keys is typically done using hashes of the key and the file
    that the client stores the hashes for known servers is often called `known_hosts`
    and is put in a dedicated SSH directory. On Linux systems that is usually called
    `~/.ssh`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When curl connects to a SFTP and SCP host, it makes sure that the host’s key
    hash is already present in the known hosts file or it denies continued operation
    because it cannot trust that the server is the right one. Once the correct hash
    exists in `known_hosts` curl can perform transfers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To force curl to skip checking and obeying to the `known_hosts` file, you can
    use the `-k / --insecure` command-line option. You must use this option with extreme
    care since it makes it possible for man-in-the-middle attacks not to be detected.
