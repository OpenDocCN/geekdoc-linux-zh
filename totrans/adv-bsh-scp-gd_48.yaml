    of this document into DocBook/SGML. While not on the job at a small French company
    as a software developer, he enjoys working on GNU/Linux documentation and software,
    reading literature, playing music, and, for his peace of mind, making merry with
    friends. You may run across him somewhere in France or in the Basque Country,
    or you can email him at [feloy@free.fr](mailto:feloy@free.fr).'
