# WebSocket

WebSocket is a transfer protocol done *on top* of HTTP that offers a general purpose bidirectional byte-stream. The protocol was created for more than just plain uploads and downloads and is more similar to something like TCP over HTTP.

A WebSocket client application sets up a connection with an HTTP request that *upgrades* into WebSocket - and once upgraded, the involved parties speak WebSocket over that connection until it is done and the connection is closed.
