- en: When told to do multiple transfers in a single command line, there might be
    times when a user would rather have those multiple transfers done slower than
    as fast as possible. We call that *request rate limiting*.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With the `--rate` option, you specify the maximum transfer frequency you allow
    curl to use - in number of transfer starts per time unit (sometimes called request
    rate). Without this option, curl starts the next transfer as fast as possible.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If given several URLs and a transfer completes faster than the allowed rate,
    curl delays starting the next transfer to maintain the requested rate. This option
    is for serial transfers and has no effect when [–parallel](ch066.xhtml#cmdline__urls__parallel__md)
    is used.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The request rate is provided as **N/U** where N is an integer number and U is
    a time unit. Supported units are `s` (second), `m` (minute), `h` (hour) and `d`
    (day, as in a 24 hour unit). The default time unit, if no **/U** is provided,
    is number of transfers per hour.

- en: If curl is told to allow 10 requests per minute, it does not start the next
    request until 6 seconds have elapsed since the previous transfer was started.

- en: This function uses millisecond resolution. If the allowed frequency is set more
    than 1000 per second, it instead runs unrestricted.

- en: When retrying transfers, enabled with [–retry](ch095.xhtml#usingcurl__downloads__retry__md),
    the separate retry delay logic is used and not this setting.
