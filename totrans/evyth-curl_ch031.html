<p>macOS comes with the curl tool bundled with the operating system for many years. If you want to upgrade to the latest version shipped by the curl project, we recommend installing <a href="https://brew.sh/">homebrew</a> (a macOS software package manager) and then install the curl package from them:</p>
<pre><code>brew install curl</code></pre>
<p>Note that when installing curl, brew does not create a <code>curl</code> symlink in the default homebrew folder, to avoid clashes with the macOS version of curl.</p>
<p>Run the following to make brew curl the default one in your shell:</p>
<pre><code>echo &#39;export PATH=&quot;$(brew --prefix)/opt/curl/bin:$PATH&quot;&#39; &gt;&gt; ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc</code></pre>
<section id="install__macos__md-_-_-get-libcurl-for-macos" class="level2" data-number="30.1">
<h2 data-number="30.1">Get libcurl for macOS</h2>
<p>When you install <code>curl</code> the tool with homebrew as described above, it also installs libcurl together with its associated headers.</p>
<p>libcurl is also installed with macOS itself and always present, and if you install the development environment <code>XCode</code> from Apple, you can use libcurl directly without having to install anything extra as the curl include files are bundled there.</p>
