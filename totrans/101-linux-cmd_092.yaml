- en: Input items are terminated by a null character instead of by whitespace, and
    the quotes and backslash are not special (every character is taken literal‐ly).
    Disables the end of file string, which is treated like any other argument. Useful
    when input items might contain white space, quote marks, or back‐slashes.

    remains unchanged when commands are run. Otherwise, stdin is redirected from /dev/null.

    This is useful if you want xargs to run an interactive application.

- en: Input items are terminated by the specified character. The specified delimiter
    may be a single character, a C-style character escape such as \n, or an octal
    or hexadecimal escape code. Octal and hexadecimal escape codes are understood
    as for the printf command. Multibyte characters are not supported. When processing
    the input, quotes and backslash are not special; every character in the input
    is taken literally. The -d option disables any end-of-file string, which is treated
    like any other argument. You can use this option when the input consists of simply
    newline-separated items, although it is al‐ most always better to design your
    program to use --null where this is possible.

- en: Find files named core in or below the directory /tmp and delete them, but more
    efficiently than in the previous example (because we avoid the need to use fork(2)
    and exec(2) to launch rm and we don't need the extra xargs process).
