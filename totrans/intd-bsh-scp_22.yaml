    that you can use for any software installation or when you sign-up to any website.

    manager/vault where you often have the option to randomly generate a password
    or to use a website that can generate the password on your behalf.

    that you can quickly use. There are a lot of ways to achieve that and I will make
    sure to cover few of them and will leave up to you to choose which option is most
    suitable with your needs.

    advance checks on the user input in order to make sure the script will continue
