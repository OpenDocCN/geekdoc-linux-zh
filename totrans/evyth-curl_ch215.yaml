- en: This callback function gets called by libcurl when it wants to send data to
    the server. This is a transfer that you have set up to upload data or otherwise
    send it off to the server. This callback is called over and over until all data
    has been delivered or the transfer failed.

- en: The data area pointed at by the pointer **buffer** should be filled up with
    at most **size** multiplied with **nitems** number of bytes by your function.
    The callback should then return the number of bytes that it stored in that memory
    area, or 0 if we have reached the end of the data. The callback can also return
    a few “magic” return codes to cause libcurl to return failure immediately or to
    pause the particular transfer. See the [CURLOPT_READFUNCTION man page](https://curl.se/libcurl/c/CURLOPT_READFUNCTION.html)
    for details.
