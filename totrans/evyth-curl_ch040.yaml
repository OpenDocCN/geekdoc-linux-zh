    code is the stuff that is needed to build the products, we are also depending
    on good documentation, testing (both test code and test infrastructure), web content,
    user support and more.

    fix problems, improve functionality, clarify documentation, add features or make
    anything else you help out with land in the proper place. We make sure improved
    code and docs get merged into the source tree properly and other sorts of contributions
    are suitable received.

    suggestions of what to do and how to do it, but the chances that the ideas actually
    turn into real features grow substantially if you also volunteer to participate
    in converting the idea into reality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The best approach to add anything to curl or libcurl is, of course, to first
    bring the idea and suggestion to the curl project team members and then discuss
    with them if the idea is feasible for inclusion and then how an implementation
    is best done—and done in the best possible way to get merged into the source code
    repository, assuming that is what you want.

    protocols, especially features that popular clients or browsers have but that

    Always start out by discussing on the list, and send your initial review requests
    early to get feedback on your design and approach. It saves you from wasting time
    going down a route that might need rewriting in the end anyway.

    that already exists. When you add code to the ordinary transfer code path, it
    must, for example, work asynchronously in a non-blocking manner. We do not accept
    new code that introduces blocking behaviors—we already have too many of those
    that we have not managed to remove yet.

    to certain areas that makes the new functionality perhaps depend on a specific
    3rd party library or a specific operating system and similar, but we can **never**
    do that at the expense of all other systems. We do not break the build, and we
    make sure all tests keep running successfully.

    to the project is by doing a so-called pull request on GitHub.
  prefs: []
