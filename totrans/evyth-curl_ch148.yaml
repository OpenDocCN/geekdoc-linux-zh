- en: As any other Internet protocol, the HTTP protocol has kept evolving over the
    years and now there are clients and servers distributed over the world and over
    time that speak different versions with varying levels of success. In order to
    get curl to work with your URLs, curl offers ways for you to specify which HTTP
    version a request and transfer should use. curl is designed in a way so that it
    tries to use the most common, the most sensible if you want, default values first
    but sometimes that is not enough and then you may need to instruct curl on what
    to do.

- en: curl defaults to HTTP/1.1 for HTTP servers but if you connect to HTTPS and you
    have a curl that has HTTP/2 abilities built-in, it attempts to negotiate HTTP/2
    automatically or falls back to 1.1 in case the negotiation failed. Non-HTTP/2
    capable curls get 1.1 over HTTPS by default.
