    When those bombs are exploded they will in turn cause all the bombs in their range
    to be exploded.

    that  can be detonated

    second bomb, both the second  and first bomb will  be exploded

- en: The idea to solve this problem is to view everything as a directed graph where
    a directed node from the first bomb to the second bomb exists if the second bomb
    lies within the range of the first bomb.
  prefs: []

- en: Once this graph is constructed, we can do DFS  from each node to get the maximum
    number of bombs it can explode. We will also store the results previously computed
    as well.
