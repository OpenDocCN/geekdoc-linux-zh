- en: You set options in the easy handle to control how that transfer is going to
    be done, or in some cases you can actually set options and modify the transfer’s
    behavior while it is in progress. You set options with `curl_easy_setopt()` and
    you provide the handle, the option you want to set and the argument to the option.
    All options take exactly one argument and you must always pass exactly three parameters
    to the `curl_easy_setopt()` calls.

- en: Since the `curl_easy_setopt()` call accepts several hundred different options
    and the various options accept a variety of different types of arguments, it is
    important to read up on the specifics and provide exactly the argument type the
    specific option supports and expects. Passing in the wrong type can lead to unexpected
    side-effects or hard to understand hiccups.

- en: 'The perhaps most important option that every transfer needs, is the URL. libcurl
    cannot perform a transfer without knowing which URL it concerns so you must tell
    it. The URL option name is `CURLOPT_URL` as all options are prefixed with `CURLOPT_`
    and then the descriptive name — all using uppercase letters. An example line setting
    the URL to get the `http://example.com` HTTP contents could look like:'

    or anything. It just tells libcurl to copy the given string and if that works
    it returns OK.'

    If you need to be able to extract the information again that you set earlier,
    we encourage you to keep track of that data yourself in your application.
