- en: By setting the `CURLWS_RAW_MODE` bit in the bitmask, libcurl delivers all WebSocket
    traffic raw to the write callback instead of parsing the WebSocket traffic itself.
    This raw mode is intended for applications that maybe implemented WebSocket handling
    already and want to just move over to use libcurl for the transfer and maintain
    its own WebSocket logic.
