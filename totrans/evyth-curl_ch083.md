# Downloads

“Download” means getting data from a server on a network, and the server is then clearly considered to be “above” you. This is loading data down from the server onto your machine where you are running curl.

Downloading is probably the most common use case for curl — retrieving the specific data pointed to by a URL onto your machine.
