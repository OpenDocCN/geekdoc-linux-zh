- en: Telnet is an ancient application protocol for bidirectional **clear-text** communication.
    It was designed for interactive text-oriented communications and *there is no
    encrypted or secure version* of Telnet.

- en: TELNET is not a perfect match for curl. The protocol is not done to handle plain
    uploads or downloads so the usual curl paradigms have had to be stretched somewhat
    to make curl deal with it appropriately.

- en: curl sends received data to stdout and it reads input to send on stdin. The
    transfer is complete when the connection is dropped or when the user presses control-c.

- en: Once upon the time, systems provided telnet access for login. Then you could
    connect to a server and login to it, much like how you would do it with SSH today.
    That practice has fortunately now mostly been moved into the museum cabinets due
    to the insecure nature of the protocol.

    the target host and port makes it somewhat useful to debug other protocols and
    services at times.
