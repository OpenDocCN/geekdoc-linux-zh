- en: The `whereis` command is used to find the location of source/binary file of
    a command and manuals sections for a specified file in Linux system. If we compare
    `whereis` command with find command they will appear similar to each other as
    both can be used for the same purposes but `whereis` command produces the result
    more accurately by consuming less time comparatively.

- en: Since the `whereis` command uses chdir(change directory 2V) to give you the
    result in the fastest possible way, the pathnames given with the -M, -S, or -B
    must be full and well-defined i.e. they must begin with a `/` and should be a
    valid path that exist in the system’s directories, else it exits without any valid
    result. `whereis` command has a hard-coded(code which is not dynamic and changes
    with specification) path, so you may not always find what you’re looking for.
