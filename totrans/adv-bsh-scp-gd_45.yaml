- en: 'This book is somewhat of a departure from his other major work, [HOW-2 Meet
    Women: The Shy Man''s Guide to Relationships](http://bash.deta.in/hmw60.zip).
    He has also written the [Software-Building HOWTO](http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Software-Building-HOWTO.html).
    Of late, he has been trying his (heavy) hand at fiction: [Dave Dawson Over Berlin
    (First Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.epub) [Dave Dawson
    Over Berlin (Second Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.II.epub)
    and [Dave Dawson Over Berlin (Third Installment)](http://bash.deta.in/dave-dawson-over-berlin.III.epub)
    . He also has a few *Instructables* ([here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Morse-Code-Shield/),
    [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Haywired-Hackduino/), [here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-DIY-SD-Card-Logging-Shield/),

- en: A Linux user since 1995 (Slackware 2.2, kernel 1.2.1), the author has emitted
    a few software truffles, including the [cruft](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/utils/file/cruft-0.2.tar.gz)
    one-time pad encryption utility, the [mcalc](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/apps/financial/mcalc-1.6.tar.gz)
    mortgage calculator, the [judge](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/games/amusements/judge-1.0.tar.gz)
    Scrabble adjudicator, the [yawl](http://ibiblio.org/pub/Linux/libs/yawl-0.3.2.tar.gz)
    word gaming list package, and the [Quacky](http://bash.deta.in/qky.README.html)
    anagramming gaming package. He got off to a rather shaky start in the computer
    game -- programming FORTRAN IV on a CDC 3800 (on paper coding pads, with occasional
    forays on a keypunch machine and a Friden Flexowriter) -- and is not the least
    bit nostalgic for those days.

    qualifications. He''s a school dropout with no formal credentials or professional
    experience whatsoever. None. Zero. Nada. Aside from the *ABS Guide*, his major
    claim to fame is a First Place in the sack race at the Colfax Elementary School
