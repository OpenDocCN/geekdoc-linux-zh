- en: Since `curl_easy_setopt()` is a vararg function where the 3rd argument can use
    different types depending on the situation, normal C language type conversion
    cannot be done. You **must** make sure that you truly pass a `long` and not an
    `int` if the documentation tells you so. On architectures where they are the same
    size, you may not get any problems but not all work like that. Similarly, for
    options that accept a `curl_off_t` type, it is **crucial** that you pass in an
    argument using that type and no other.
