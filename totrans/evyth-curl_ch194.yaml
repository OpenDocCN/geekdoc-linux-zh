- en: We actively encourage users to first try out the transfer they want to do with
    the curl command-line tool, and once it works roughly the way you want it to,
    you append the `--libcurl [filename]` option to the command line and run it again.

- en: The `--libcurl` command-line option creates a C program in the provided file
    name. That C program is an application that uses libcurl to run the transfer you
    just had the curl command-line tool do. There are some exceptions and it is not
    always a 100% match, but you might find that it can serve as an excellent inspiration
    source for what libcurl options you want or can use and what additional arguments
    to provide to them.

- en: If you specify the filename as a single dash, as in `--libcurl -` you get the
    program written to stdout instead of a file.
