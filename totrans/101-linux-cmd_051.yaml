- en: This is the equivalent of "run as administrator" option in Windows. The `sudo`
    command allows you to elevate your current user account to have root privileges.
    Also, the root privilege in `sudo` is only valid for a temporary amount of time.
    Once that time expires, you have to enter your password again to regain root privilege.
