- en: In every HTTP request, there is a method. Sometimes called a verb. The most
    commonly used ones are `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD` and `PUT`.

- en: Normally however you do not specify the method in the command line, but instead
    the exact method used depends on the specific options you use. `GET` is default,
    using `-d` or `-F` makes it a `POST`, `-I` generates a `HEAD` and `-T` sends a
    `PUT`.
