- en: A Bash *alias* is essentially nothing more than a keyboard shortcut, an abbreviation,
    a means of avoiding typing a long command sequence. If, for example, we include
    **alias lm="ls -l | more"** in the [`~/.bashrc` file](sample-bashrc.html), then
    each `**lm**` [[1]](#FTN.AEN18669) typed at the command-line will automatically
    be replaced by a **ls -l | more**. This can save a great deal of typing at the
    command-line and avoid having to remember complex combinations of commands and
    options. Setting **alias rm="rm -i"** (interactive mode delete) may save a good
    deal of grief, since it can prevent inadvertently deleting important files.

- en: In a script, aliases have very limited usefulness. It would be nice if aliases
    could assume some of the functionality of the **C** preprocessor, such as macro
    expansion, but unfortunately Bash does not expand arguments within the alias body.
    [[2]](#FTN.AEN18676) Moreover, a script fails to expand an alias itself within
    "compound constructs," such as [if/then](tests.html#IFTHEN) statements, loops,
    and functions. An added limitation is that an alias will not expand recursively.
    Almost invariably, whatever we would like an alias to do could be accomplished
    much more effectively with a [function](functions.html#FUNCTIONREF).
