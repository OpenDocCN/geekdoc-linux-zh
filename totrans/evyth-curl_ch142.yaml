- en: Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) is a simple clear-text protocol that allows
    a client to get a file from or put a file onto a remote host.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Primary use cases for this protocol have been to get the boot image over a local
    network. TFTP also stands out a little next to many other protocols by the fact
    that it is done over UDP as opposed to TCP which most other protocols use.

- en: The TFTP protocols transmits data to the other end of the communication using
    “blocks”. When a TFTP transfer is setup, both parties either agree on using the
    default block size of 512 bytes or negotiate a different one. curl supports block
    sizes between 8 to 65464 bytes.

    option negotiation at all, so curl also has the ability to completely switch off
    all attempts of setting options. If you are in the unfortunate of working with
    such a server, use the flag like this:'
