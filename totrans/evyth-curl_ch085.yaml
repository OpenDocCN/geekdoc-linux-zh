- en: If you try the example download as in the previous section, you might notice
    that curl outputs the downloaded data to stdout unless told to do something else.
    Outputting data to stdout is really useful when you want to pipe it into another
    program or similar, but it is not always the optimal way to deal with your downloads.

- en: Give curl a specific filename to save the download in with `-o [filename]` (with
    `--output` as the long version of the option), where filename is either just a
    filename, a relative path to a filename or a full path to the file.

- en: If you ask curl to send the output to the terminal, it attempts to detect and
    prevent binary data from being sent there since that can seriously mess up your
    terminal (sometimes to the point where it stops working). You can override curl’s
    binary-output-prevention and force the output to get sent to stdout by using `-o
    -`.

- en: When curl downloads a remote resource into a local filename as described above,
    it overwrites that file in case it already existed. It *clobbers* it.

- en: When using this option, and curl finds that there already exists a file with
    the given name, curl instead appends a period plus a number to the filename in
    an attempt to find a name that is not already used. It starts with `1` and then
    continues trying numbers until it reaches `100` and picks the first available
    one.

- en: 'For example, if you ask curl to download a URL to `picture.png`, and in that
    directory there already are two files called `picture.png` and `picture.png.1`,
    the following saves the file as `picture.png.2`:'

    option’s `%filename_effective` variable to figure out which name that was eventually
    used.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By default, if curl runs into a problem during a download and exits with an
    error, the partially transferred file is left as-is. It could be a small fraction
    of the intended file, or it could be almost the entire thing. It is up to the
    user to decide what to do with the leftovers.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The `--remove-on-error` command line option changes this behavior. It tells
    curl to delete any partially saved file if curl exits with an error. No more leftovers.
