<h1 data-number="65">Connection reuse</h1>
<p>Setting up a TCP connection and especially a TLS connection can be a slow process, even on high bandwidth networks.</p>
<p>It can be useful to remember that curl has a connection pool internally which keeps previously used connections alive and around for a while after they were used so that subsequent requests to the same hosts can reuse an already established connection.</p>
<p>Of course, they can only be kept alive for as long as the curl tool is running. It is a good reason for trying to get several transfers done within the same command line instead of running several independent curl command line invocations.</p>
