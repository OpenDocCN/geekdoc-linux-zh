    <h1>The <code>cmatrix</code> command</h1>
    <p>This command doesn't come by default in Linux. It has to be installed, and as seen in chapter <a href="/ebook/en/content/052-the-apt-command.md">052</a> we need to run the following command:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript hljs javascript" data-lang="javascript">sudo apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> install cmatrix
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>And after everything is installed, you have become a 'legit hacker'. In order to use this command, just type in <code>cmatrix</code> and press enter:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">cmatrix
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>And this is what you should see:</p>
    <p>

    </p>
    <p>As you can see you have access to the matrix now. Well, not really.</p>
    <p>What this actually is just a fun little command to goof around with. There are actually a few options you can use. For examle you can change the text colour. You can choose from <strong>green, red, blue, white, yellow, cyan, magenta and black</strong>.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">cmatrix -C red
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>
      <img src="images/https/imgur.com/PwMXSVx.png" alt="Red Matrix"/>
    </p>
    <p>And the falling characters will be red. This command isn't really something that will help you with your job or anything, but it is fun to know that you can have some fun in Linux.</p>
