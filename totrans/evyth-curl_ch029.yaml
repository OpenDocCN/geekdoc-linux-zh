- en: '[MSYS2](https://www.msys2.org/) is a popular build system for Windows based
    on [mingw-w64](https://www.mingw-w64.org/) and includes both gcc and clang compilers.
    MSYS2 uses a package manager named `pacman` (a port from arch-linux) and has about
    2000 precompiled [mingw-packages](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages). MSYS2
    is designed to build standalone software: the binaries built with mingw-w64 compilers
    do not depend on MSYS2 itself[^1].'

- en: This package contains both the `curl` command line tool as well as libcurl headers
    and shared libraries. The default `curl` packages are built with the OpenSSL backend
    and hence depend on `mingw-w64-x86_64-openssl`. There are also `mingw-w64-x86_64-curl-gnutls`
    and `mingw-w64-x86_64-curl-gnutls` packages, refer to the [msys2 website](https://packages.msys2.org/base/mingw-w64-curl)

    process is contained in the [PKGBUILD](https://github.com/msys2/MINGW-packages/blob/master/mingw-w64-curl/PKGBUILD)
    file from the `mingw-w64-curl` package. We can easily modify the file to rebuild
