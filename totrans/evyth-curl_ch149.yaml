- en: The HTTP version used before HTTP/1.0 was made available is often referred to
    as HTTP/0.9\. Back in those days, HTTP responses had no headers as they would
    only return a response body and then immediately close the connection.

- en: curl can be told to support such responses but by default it does not recognize
    them, for security reasons. Almost anything bad looks like an HTTP/0.9 response
    to curl so the option needs to be used with caution.

- en: The HTTP/0.9 option to curl is different than the other HTTP command line options
    for HTTP versions mentioned above as this controls what response to accept, while
    the others are about what HTTP protocol version to try to use.
