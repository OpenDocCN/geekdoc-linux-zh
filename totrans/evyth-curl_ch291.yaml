- en: libcurl offers a few different APIs to do transfers; where the primary differences
    are the synchronous easy interface versus the non-blocking multi interface. The
    multi interface itself can then be further used either by using the event-driven
    socket interface or the normal perform interface.

- en: Internally however, everything is written for the event-driven interface. Everything
    needs to be written in non-blocking fashion so that functions are never waiting
    for data in loop or similar. Unless they are the surface functions that have that
    expressed functionality.

- en: The function `curl_easy_perform()` which performs a single transfer synchronously,
    is itself just a wrapper function that internally setups and uses the multi interface
    itself.
