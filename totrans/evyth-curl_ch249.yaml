- en: What if the client only wants the first 200 bytes out of a remote resource or
    perhaps 300 bytes somewhere in the middle? The HTTP protocol allows a client to
    ask for only a specific data range. The client asks the server for the specific
    range with a start offset and an end offset. It can even combine things and ask
    for several ranges in the same request by just listing a bunch of pieces next
    to each other. When a server sends back multiple independent pieces to answer
    such a request, you get them separated with mime boundary strings and it is up
    to the user application to handle that accordingly. curl does not further separate
    such a response.

- en: However, a byte range is only a request to the server. It does not have to respect
    the request and in many cases, like when the server automatically generates the
    contents on the fly when it is being asked, it simply refuses to do it and it
    then instead respond with the full contents anyway.
