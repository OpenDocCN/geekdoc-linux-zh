- en: This is the `-O` (uppercase letter o) option, or `--remote-name` for the long
    name version. The -O option selects the local filename to use by picking the filename
    part of the URL that you provide. This is important. You specify the URL and curl
    picks the name from this data. If the site redirects curl further (and if you
    tell curl to follow redirects), it does not change the filename curl uses for
    storing this.

- en: As a reaction to adding a hundred `-O` options when using a hundred URLs, we
    introduced an option called `--remote-name-all`. This makes `-O` the default operation
    for all given URLs. You can still provide individual “storage instructions” for
    URLs but if you leave one out for a URL that gets downloaded, the default action
    is then switched from stdout to -O style.
