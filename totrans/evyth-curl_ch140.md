# MQTT

A plain GET subscribes to the topic and prints all published messages. Doing a POST publishes the post data to the topic and exits.

Subscribe to the temperature in the `home/bedroom` subject published by example.com:

[PRE0]

Send the value `75` to the `home/bedroom/dimmer` subject hosted by the example.com server:

[PRE1]

## What does curl deliver as a response to a subscribe

It outputs two bytes topic length (MSB | LSB), the topic followed by the payload.

## Caveats

Remaining limitations in curl’s MQTT support as of September 2022:

*   Only QoS level 0 is implemented for publish
*   No way to set retain flag for publish
*   No TLS (mqtts) support
