<h1>Preface for the fourth edition#</h1>
<blockquote>原文：<a href="https://4ed.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/preface.html">https://4ed.computer-networking.info/syllabus/default/preface.html</a></blockquote>

<p>The fourth edition of the textbook introduces a major change compared to the
previous editions. There previous editions started from the principles before
explaining the actual protocols that are used in deployed networks. From a
pedagogical viewpoint, this approach had the benefit of allowing the students
to first understand the basic principles and then explore in details how
existing protocols use them. Unfortunately, the main drawback of this approach
was that students spent half their semester to understand abstract protocols.
They had to wait until the second half of the course to be able to understand
the protocols that they use every day. This created a lot of frustration among
students and motivated us to explore a different way to explain computer
networking to students. This approach has been tested during two years
at <a class="reference external" href="https://www.uclouvain.be">UCLouvain</a> and worked well. We have adopted it for the fourth edition
of the ebook.</p>
<p>The ebook is now divided in two main parts. The first part considers the
network as a black box and focuses on the interactions between the hosts.
During this part, student explore networked applications, security, naming
and addressing and most functions of the transport layer except
congestion control. The network
and datalink layers are briefly explained with a focus on the frame and
packet formats. The second part of the ebook opens the black box and describes
in more details the control plane protocols, mainly the routing protocols
(both intradomain and interdomain routing), but also the Spanning
Tree Protocol and Medium Access Control techniques. We also explain the traffic
control techniques which can be used on routers and how congestion control
operates on hosts.</p>
<p>A key benefit of this approach is that students can quickly carry hands-on
exercises with real protocols during the first semester. The previous approach
relied more on traditional paper/pencil exercises. At <a class="reference external" href="https://www.uclouvain.be">UCLouvain</a> students
work on two projects in parallel with the course. The first project focuses on
the host part. The students use <a class="reference external" href="https://www.wireshark.org">Wireshark</a> and similar tools to explore the
packets exchanged by an application or a browser when interacting with a
website. This forces them to better understand the protocols used by hosts
in more details in parallel with the course. The second project builds
upon the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/nsg-ethz/mini_internet_project">Mini Internet project</a>
designed by Laurent Vanbever and his colleagues at ETH Zurich <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#hbr2020" id="id1"><span>[HBR2020]</span></a></p>

<h1>Preface for the first editions<a class="headerlink" href="#preface-for-the-first-editions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h1>
<p>This textbook came from a frustration of first main author. Many authors choose to write a textbook because there are no textbooks in their field or because they are not satisfied with the existing textbooks. This frustration has produced several excellent textbooks in the networking community. At a time when networking textbooks were mainly theoretical, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.cs.purdue.edu/people/comer">Douglas Comer</a> chose to write a textbook entirely focused on the TCP/IP protocol suite <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#comer1988" id="id2"><span>[Comer1988]</span></a>, a difficult choice at that time. He later extended his textbook by describing a complete TCP/IP implementation, adding practical considerations to the theoretical descriptions in <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#comer1988" id="id3"><span>[Comer1988]</span></a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www.kohala.com/">Richard Stevens</a> approached the Internet like an explorer and explained the operation of protocols by looking at all the packets that were exchanged on the wire <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#stevens1994" id="id4"><span>[Stevens1994]</span></a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://www-net.cs.umass.edu/personnel/kurose.html">Jim Kurose</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/keith-ross">Keith Ross</a> reinvented the networking textbooks by starting from the applications that the students use and later explained the Internet protocols by removing one layer after the other <a class="reference internal" href="bibliography.html#kuroseross09" id="id5"><span>[KuroseRoss09]</span></a>.</p>
<p>The frustrations that motivated this book are different. When I started to teach networking in the late 1990s, students were already Internet users, but their usage was limited. Students were still using reference textbooks and spent time in the library. Today’s students are completely different. They are avid and experienced web users who find lots of information on the web. This is a positive attitude since they are probably more curious than their predecessors. Thanks to the information that is available on the Internet, they can check or obtain additional information about the topics explained by their teachers. This abundant information creates several challenges for a teacher. Until the end of the nineteenth century, a teacher was by definition more knowledgeable than his students and it was very difficult for the students to verify the lessons given by their teachers. Today, given the amount of information available at the fingertips of each student through the Internet, verifying a lesson or getting more information about a given topic is sometimes only a few clicks away. Websites such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org">wikipedia</a> provide lots of information on various topics and students often consult them. Unfortunately, the organization of the information on these websites is not well suited to allow students to learn from them. Furthermore, there are huge differences in the quality and depth of the information that is available for different topics.</p>
<p>The second reason is that the computer networking community is a strong participant in the open-source movement. Today, there are high-quality and widely used open-source implementations for most networking protocols. This includes the TCP/IP implementations that are part of <a class="reference external" href="https://www.linux.org">linux</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.freebsd.org">freebsd</a> or the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sics.se/~adam/uip/index.php/Main_Page">uIP</a> stack running on 8bits controllers, but also servers such as <a class="reference external" href="https://www.isc.org/software/bind">bind</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.unbound.net">unbound</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://www.apache.org">apache</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.sendmail.org">sendmail</a> and implementations of routing protocols such as <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XORP">xorp</a> or <a class="reference external" href="https://www.quagga.net">quagga</a> . Furthermore, the documents that define almost all of the Internet protocols have been developed within the Internet Engineering Task Force (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ietf.org">IETF</a>) using an open process. The IETF publishes its protocol specifications in the publicly available <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ietf.org/rfc.html">RFC</a> and new proposals are described in <a class="reference external" href="https://www.ietf.org/standards/ids/">Internet drafts</a>.</p>
<p>This open textbook aims to fill the gap between the open-source implementations and the open-source network specifications by providing a detailed but pedagogical description of the key principles that guide the operation of the Internet. The book is released under a <a class="reference external" href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/">creative commons license</a>. Such an open-source license is motivated by two reasons. The first is that we hope that this will allow many students to use the book to learn computer networks. The second is that I hope that other teachers will reuse, adapt and improve it. Time will tell if it is possible to build a community of contributors to improve and develop the book further. As a starting point, the first release contains all the material for a one-semester first upper undergraduate or a graduate networking course.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="https://www.computer-networking.info/firstedition.html">first edition</a> of this ebook has been written by <a class="reference external" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/obo.html">Olivier Bonaventure</a>. <a class="reference external" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/lvanbeve.html">Laurent Vanbever</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/vvandens.html">Virginie Van den Schriek</a>, <a class="reference external" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/dsaucez.html">Damien Saucez</a> and <a class="reference external" href="https://inl.info.ucl.ac.be/mhoerdt.html">Mickael Hoerdt</a> have contributed to exercises.
