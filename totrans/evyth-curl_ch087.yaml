- en: HTTP servers have the option to provide a header named `Content-Disposition:`
    in responses. That header may contain a suggested filename for the contents delivered,
    and curl can be told to use that hint to name its local file. The `-J / --remote-header-name`
    enables this. If you also use the `-O` option, it makes curl use the filename
    from the URL by default and only *if* there is actually a valid Content-Disposition
    header available, it switches to saving using that name.

- en: It only uses the rightmost part of the suggested filename, so any path or directories
    the server suggests are stripped out.

- en: Since the filename is entirely selected by the server, curl might overwrite
    any preexisting local file in your current directory if the server happens to
    provide such a filename (unless you use `--no-clobber`).

- en: filename encoding and character sets issues. curl does not decode the name in
    any way, so you may end up with a URL-encoded filename where a browser would otherwise
    decode it to something more readable using a sensible character set.
