- en: The exception to the rule that libcurl always copies data, `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS`
    only stores the pointer to the data, meaning an application using this option
    **must** keep the memory around for the entire duration of the associated transfer.

- en: If that is problematic, an alternative is to instead use `CURLOPT_COPYPOSTFIELDS`
    which copies the data. If the data is binary and does not stop at the first presence
    of a null byte, make sure that `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDSIZE` is set *before* this option
    is used.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H3
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The reason `CURLOPT_POSTFIELDS` is an exception is due to legacy. Originally
    (before curl 7.17.0), libcurl did not copy *any* string arguments and when this
    current behavior was introduced, this option could not be converted over without
    breaking behavior so it had to keep working like before. Which now sticks out,
    as no other option does…

- en: If you use libcurl from a C++ program, it is important to remember that you
    cannot pass in a string object where libcurl expects a string. It has to be a
    null terminated C string. Usually you can make this happen with the `c_str()`
    method.
