    networks when the distance between the communication devices is larger than one
    kilometer. There are two main types of optical fibers : multi-mode and single-mode.
    Multi-mode is much cheaper than single-mode fiber because a LED can be used to
    send a signal over a multi-mode fiber while a single-mode fiber must be driven
    by a laser. Due to the different modes of propagation of light, multi-mode fibers
    are limited to distances of a few kilometers while single-mode fibers can be used
    over distances greater than several tens of kilometers. In both cases, repeaters
    can be used to regenerate the optical signal at one endpoint of a fiber to send

    a basis to understand how hosts communicate. From a computer science viewpoint,
    dealing with voltages is unusual. Computer scientists frequently rely on models
    that enable them to reason about the issues that they face without having to consider
    all implementation details. The physical transmission scheme described above can
    be represented by using a time-sequence diagram.

- en: A time-sequence diagram describes the interactions between communicating hosts.
    By convention, the communicating hosts are represented in the left and right parts
    of the diagram, while the electrical link occupies the middle of the diagram.
    In such a time-sequence diagram, time flows from the top to the bottom of the
    diagram. The transmission of one bit of information is represented by three arrows.
    Starting from the left, the first horizontal arrow represents the request to transmit
    one bit of information. This request is represented by a primitive, which can
    be considered as a kind of procedure call. This primitive has one parameter (the
    bit being transmitted) and a name (DATA.request in this example). By convention,
    all primitives that are named something.request correspond to a request to transmit
    some information. The dashed arrow indicates the transmission of the corresponding
    electrical signal on the wire. Electrical and optical signals do not travel instantaneously.
    The diagonal dashed arrow indicates that it takes some time for the electrical
    signal to be transmitted from Host A to Host B. Upon reception of the electrical
    signal, the electronics on Host B’s network interface detect the voltage and convert
    it into a bit. This bit is delivered as a DATA.indication primitive. All primitives
    that are named something.indication correspond to the reception of some information.
    The dashed lines also represent the relationship between two (or more) primitives.
    Such a time-sequence diagram provides information about the ordering of the different
    primitives, but the distance between two primitives does not represent a precise
    amount of time.

    of a given communication scheme. When considering the above transmission scheme,
    it is useful to evaluate whether this scheme allows the two communicating hosts
    to reliably exchange information. A digital transmission is considered reliable
    when a sequence of bits that is transmitted by a host is received correctly at
    the other end of the wire. In practice, achieving perfect reliability when transmitting
    information using the above scheme is difficult. Several problems can occur with
    such a transmission scheme.
  prefs: []

    interference. Interference can have various sources including natural phenomena
    (like thunderstorms, variations of the magnetic field,…) but also other electrical
    signals (such as interference from neighboring cables, interference from neighboring
    antennas,…). Due to these various types of interference, there is unfortunately
    no guarantee that when a host transmits one bit on a wire, the same bit is received
    at the other end. This is illustrated in the figure below where a DATA.request(0)
    on the left host leads to a Data.indication(1) on the right host.

- en: With the above transmission scheme, a bit is transmitted by setting the voltage
    on the electrical cable to a specific value during some period of time. We have
    seen that due to electromagnetic interference, the voltage measured by the receiver
    can differ from the voltage set by the transmitter. This is the main cause of
    transmission errors. However, this is not the only type of problem that can occur.
    Besides defining the voltages for bits 0 and 1, the above transmission scheme
    also specifies the duration of each bit. If one million bits are sent every second,
    then each bit lasts 1 microsecond. On each host, the transmission (resp. the reception)
    of each bit is triggered by a local clock having a 1 MHz frequency. These clocks
    are the second source of problems when transmitting bits over a wire. Although
    the two clocks have the same specification, they run on different hosts, possibly
    at a different temperature and with a different source of energy. In practice,
    it is possible that the two clocks do not operate at exactly the same frequency.
    Assume that the clock of the transmitting host operates at exactly 1000000 Hz
    while the receiving clock operates at 999999 Hz. This is a very small difference
    between the two clocks. However, when using the clock to transmit bits, this difference
    is important. With its 1000000 Hz clock, the transmitting host will generate one
    million bits during a period of one second. During the same period, the receiving
    host will sense the wire 999999 times and thus will receive one bit less than
    the bits originally transmitted. This small difference in clock frequencies implies
    that bits can “disappear” during their transmission on an electrical cable. This
    is illustrated in the figure below.

    an electrical cable. All physical layers are able to send and receive physical
    symbols that represent values 0 and 1. However, for various reasons that are outside
    the scope of this chapter, several physical layers exchange other physical symbols
    as well. For example, the Manchester encoding used in several physical layers
    can send four different symbols. The Manchester encoding is a differential encoding
    scheme in which time is divided into fixed-length periods. Each period is divided
    into two halves and two different voltage levels can be applied. To send a symbol,
    the sender must set one of these two voltage levels during each half period. To
    send a 1 (resp. 0), the sender must set a high (resp. low) voltage during the
    first half of the period and a low (resp. high) voltage during the second half.
    This encoding ensures that there will be a transition at the middle of each period
    and allows the receiver to synchronize its clock to the sender’s clock. Apart
    from the encodings for 0 and 1, the Manchester encoding also supports two additional
    symbols : InvH and InvB where the same voltage level is used for the two half
    periods. By definition, these two symbols cannot appear inside a frame which is
    only composed of 0 and 1. Some technologies use these special symbols as markers
    for the beginning or end of frames. This encoding is illustrated in [Fig. 2](#fig-manchester).'

    the receiver could receive 011 or 101 or 110. In these three cases, the receiver
    will decode the received bit pattern as a 1 since it contains a majority of bits
    set to 1. If there are two bits in error, the receiver will not be able anymore
    to recover from the transmission error.

    source bit. However, it allows the receiver to correct single bit errors. More
    advanced coding systems that allow recovering from errors are used in several

- en: 'To understand error detection codes, let us consider two devices that exchange
    bit strings containing N bits. To allow the receiver to detect a transmission
    error, the sender converts each string of N bits into a string of N+r bits. Usually,
    the r redundant bits are added at the beginning or the end of the transmitted
    bit string, but some techniques interleave redundant bits with the original bits.
    An error detection code can be defined as a function that computes the r redundant
    bits corresponding to each string of N bits. The simplest error detection code
    is the parity bit. There are two types of parity schemes : even and odd parity.
    With the even (resp. odd) parity scheme, the redundant bit is chosen so that an
    even (resp. odd) number of bits are set to 1 in the transmitted bit string of
    N+r bits. The receiver can easily recompute the parity of each received bit string
    and discard the strings with an invalid parity. The parity scheme is often used
    when 7-bit characters are exchanged. In this case, the eighth bit is often a parity
    bit. The table below shows the parity bits that are computed for bit strings containing
    three bits.'

    a single bit among the transmitted N+r bits. If there are two or more bits in
    error, the receiver may not necessarily be able to detect the transmission error.
    More powerful error detection schemes have been defined. The Cyclical Redundancy
    Checks (CRC) are widely used in datalink layer protocols. An N-bits CRC can detect
    all transmission errors affecting a burst of less than N bits in the transmitted
    frame and all transmission errors that affect an odd number of bits. Additional
    details about CRCs may be found in [[Williams1993]](../bibliography.html#williams1993).

    errors. The simplest error correction code is the triple modular redundancy (TMR).
    To transmit a bit set to 1 (resp. 0), the sender transmits 111 (resp. 000). When
    there are no transmission errors, the receiver can decode 111 as 1. If transmission
    errors have affected a single bit, the receiver performs majority voting as shown
    in the table below. This scheme allows the receiver to correct all transmission
    errors that affect a single bit.

    a wire (or a wireless link) are usually known as the physical layer. The physical
    layer allows two or more entities that are directly attached to the same transmission
    medium to exchange bits. Being able to exchange bits is important as virtually
    any information can be encoded as a sequence of bits. Electrical engineers are

    also store streams of bits. There are hardware devices that process the bit stream
    produced by a hard-disk, but computer scientists have designed filesystems to
    allow applications to easily access such storage devices. These filesystems are
    typically divided into several layers as well. Hard-disks store sectors of 512
    bytes or more. Unix filesystems group sectors in larger blocks that can contain
    data or inodes representing the structure of the filesystem. Finally, applications
    manipulate files and directories that are translated into blocks, sectors, and
    eventually bits by the operating system.

    hosts. They prefer to write software that deals with larger blocks of data in
    order to transmit messages or complete files. Thanks to the physical layer service,
    it is possible to send a continuous stream of bits between two hosts. This stream
    of bits can include logical blocks of data, but we need to be able to extract
    each block of data from the bit stream despite the imperfections of the physical
    layer. In many networks, the basic unit of information exchanged between two directly
    connected hosts is often called a frame. A frame can be defined as a sequence
    of bits that has a particular syntax or structure. We will see examples of such
    frames later in this chapter.

    problem slightly more complex. Several solutions have been proposed and are used

    idle for some time after the transmission of each frame. These idle periods can
    be detected by the receiver and serve as a marker to delineate frame boundaries.
    Unfortunately, this solution is not acceptable for two reasons. First, some physical
    layers cannot remain idle and always need to transmit bits. Second, inserting
    an idle period between frames decreases the maximum bit rate that can be achieved.

    as listed in the [Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary)
    is a range of radio frequencies which is occupied by a modulated carrier wave,
    which is assigned to a service, or over which a device can operate. This definition
    corresponds to the characteristics of a given transmission medium or receiver.
    For example, the human ear is able to decode sounds in roughly the 0-20 KHz frequency
    range. By extension, bandwidth is also used to represent the capacity of a communication
    system in bits per second. For example, a Gigabit Ethernet link is theoretically
    capable of transporting one billion bits per second.

- en: Bit stuffing reserves the 01111110 bit string as the frame boundary marker and
    ensures that there will never be six consecutive 1 symbols transmitted by the
    physical layer inside a frame. With bit stuffing, a frame is sent as follows.
    First, the sender transmits the marker, i.e. 01111110. Then, it sends all the
    bits of the frame and inserts an additional bit set to 0 after each sequence of
    five consecutive 1 bits. This ensures that the sent frame never contains a sequence
    of six consecutive bits set to 1. As a consequence, the marker pattern cannot
    appear inside the frame sent. The marker is also sent to mark the end of the frame.
    The receiver performs the opposite to decode a received frame. It first detects
    the beginning of the frame thanks to the 01111110 marker. Then, it processes the
    received bits and counts the number of consecutive bits set to 1. If a 0 follows
    five consecutive bits set to 1, this bit is removed since it was inserted by the
    sender. If a 1 follows five consecutive bits set to 1, it indicates a marker if
    it is followed by a bit set to 0. The table below illustrates the application
    of bit stuffing to some frames.

    worst case for bit stuffing is of course a long sequence of bits set to 1 inside
    the frame. If transmission errors occur, stuffed bits or markers can be in error.
    In these cases, the frame affected by the error and possibly the next frame will
    not be correctly decoded by the receiver, but it will be able to resynchronize
    itself at the next valid marker.

    character stuffing techniques use the DLE, STX, and ETX characters of the ASCII
    character set. DLE STX (resp. DLE ETX) is used to mark the beginning (end) of
    a frame. When transmitting a frame, the sender adds a DLE character after each
    transmitted DLE character. This ensures that none of the markers can appear inside
    the transmitted frame. The receiver detects the frame boundaries and removes the
    second DLE when it receives two consecutive DLE characters. For example, to transmit
    frame 1 2 3 DLE STX 4, a sender will first send DLE STX as a marker, followed
    by 1 2 3 DLE. Then, the sender transmits an additional DLE character followed
    by STX 4 and the DLE ETX marker.

    even recover from transmission errors. To allow a receiver to notice transmission
    errors, a sender must add some redundant information as an error detection code
    to the frame sent. This error detection code is computed by the sender on the
    frame that it transmits. When the receiver receives a frame with an error detection
    code, it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code
    matches the computed error detection code. If they match, the frame is considered
    to be valid.

    to the same physical medium. This is the task of the network layer. The network
    layer is built above the datalink layer. Network layer entities exchange packets.
    A packet is a finite sequence of bytes that is transported by the datalink layer
    inside one or more frames. A packet usually contains information about its origin
    and its destination, and usually passes through several intermediate devices called
    routers on its way from its origin to its destination. This is illustrated in
    [Fig. 5](#fig-network-layer).

    IPv4 supports variable-length subnets where the subnet identifier can be any size,
    from 1 to 31 bits. Variable-length subnets allow the network operators to use
    a subnet that better matches the number of hosts that are placed inside the subnet.
    A subnet identifier or IPv4 prefix is usually represented as `A.B.C.D/p` where
    `A.B.C.D` is the network address obtained by concatenating the subnet identifier
    with a host identifier containing only 0 and p is the length of the subnet identifier

- en: These imperfections of the connectionless network layer service are caused by
    the operations of the network layer. This layer is able to deliver packets to
    their intended destination, but it cannot guarantee their delivery. The main cause
    of packet losses and errors are the buffers used on the network nodes. If the
    buffers of one of these nodes becomes full, all arriving packets must be discarded.
    This situation frequently happens in practice. Transmission errors can also affect
    packet transmissions on links where reliable transmission techniques are not enabled
    or because of errors in the buffers of the network nodes.

    Service Data Units. On the Internet, this service is provided by the UDP protocol
    that will be explained in the next chapter. The connectionless transport service
    on the Internet is unreliable, but is able to detect transmission errors. This

    primitive containing Service Data Unit (SDU) M that must be delivered by the service
    provider to destination D. The dashed line between the two primitives indicates
    that the Data.indication primitive that is delivered to the user on the right
    corresponds to the Data.request primitive sent by the user on the left.

- en: There are several possible implementations of the connectionless service. Before
    studying these realizations, it is useful to discuss the possible characteristics
    of the connectionless service. A reliable connectionless service is a service
    where the service provider guarantees that all SDUs submitted in Data.requests
    by a user will eventually be delivered to their destination. Such a service would
    be very useful for users, but guaranteeing perfect delivery is difficult in practice.
    For this reason, network layers usually support an unreliable connectionless service.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An unreliable connectionless service may suffer from various types of problems
    compared to a reliable connectionless service. First of all, an unreliable connectionless
    service does not guarantee the delivery of all SDUs. This can be expressed graphically
    by using the time-sequence diagram below.

    fraction of the SDUs. However, since the delivery of SDUs is not guaranteed, the

    that it may duplicate SDUs. Some packets may be duplicated in a network and be

- en: An invocation of the connection-oriented service is divided into three phases.
    The first phase is the establishment of a connection. A connection is a temporary
    association between two users through a service provider. Several connections
    may exist at the same time between any pair of users. Once established, the connection
    is used to transfer SDUs. Connections usually provide one bidirectional stream
    supporting the exchange of SDUs between the two users that are associated through
    the connection. This stream is used to transfer data during the second phase of
    the connection called the data transfer phase. The third phase is the termination
    of the connection. Once the users have finished exchanging SDUs, they request
    the service provider to terminate the connection. As we will see later, there
    are also some cases where the service provider may need to terminate a connection
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The establishment of a connection can be modeled by using four primitives :
    Connect.request, Connect.indication, Connect.response and Connect.confirm. The
    Connect.request primitive is used to request the establishment of a connection.
    The main parameter of this primitive is the address of the destination user. The
    service provider delivers a Connect.indication primitive to inform the destination
    user of the connection attempt. If it accepts to establish a connection, it responds
    with a Connect.response primitive. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be established and the destination user can start sending SDUs over the connection.
    The service provider processes the Connect.response and will deliver a Connect.confirm
    to the user who initiated the connection. The delivery of this primitive terminates
    the connection establishment phase. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be open and both users can send SDUs. A successful connection establishment
    is illustrated below.'

    not all connections are successfully established. One reason is that the destination
    user may not agree, for policy or performance reasons, to establish a connection
    with the initiating user at this time. In this case, the destination user responds
    to the Connect.indication primitive by a Disconnect.request primitive that contains
    a parameter to indicate why the connection has been refused. The service provider
    will then deliver a Disconnect.indication primitive to inform the initiating user.

- en: Once the connection has been established, the service provider supplies two
    data streams to the communicating users. The first data stream can be used by
    the initiating user to send SDUs. The second data stream allows the responding
    user to send SDUs to the initiating user. The data streams can be organized in
    different ways. A first organization is the message-mode transfer. With the message-mode
    transfer, the service provider guarantees that one and only one Data.indication
    will be delivered to the endpoint of the data stream for each Data.request primitive
    issued by the other endpoint. The message-mode transfer is illustrated in the
    figure below. The main advantage of the message-transfer mode is that the recipient
    receives exactly the SDUs that were sent by the other user. If each SDU contains
    a command, the receiving user can process each command as soon as it receives
    a SDU.

- en: Unfortunately, the message-mode transfer is not widely used on the Internet.
    On the Internet, the most popular connection-oriented service transfers SDUs in
    stream-mode. With the stream-mode, the service provider supplies a byte stream
    that links the two communicating users. The sending user sends bytes by using
    Data.request primitives that contain sequences of bytes as SDUs. The service provider
    delivers SDUs containing consecutive bytes to the receiving user by using Data.indication
    primitives. The service provider ensures that all the bytes sent at one end of
    the stream are delivered correctly in the same order at the other endpoint. However,
    the service provider does not attempt to preserve the boundaries of the SDUs.
    There is no relation enforced by the service provider between the number of Data.request
    and the number of Data.indication primitives. The stream-mode is illustrated in
    the figure below. In practice, a consequence of the utilization of the stream-mode
    is that if the users want to exchange structured SDUs, they will need to provide
    the mechanisms that allow the receiving user to separate successive SDUs in the
    byte stream that it receives. Application layer protocols often use specific delimiters
    such as the end of line character to delineate SDUs in a bytestream.

- en: The third phase of a connection is its release. As a connection involves three
    parties (two users and one service provider), any of them can request the termination
    of the connection. Usually, connections are terminated upon request of one user
    once the data transfer is finished. However, sometimes the service provider may
    be forced to terminate a connection. This can be due to lack of resources inside
    the service provider or because one of the users is not reachable anymore through
    the network. In this case, the service provider will issue Disconnect.indication
    primitives to both users. These primitives will contain, as parameter, some information
    about the reason for the termination of the connection. Unfortunately, as illustrated
    in the figure below, when a service provider is forced to terminate a connection
    it cannot guarantee that all SDUs sent by each user have been delivered to the
    other user. This connection release is said to be abrupt as it can cause losses
    of data.

    user needs, for any reason, to terminate a connection quickly, it can issue a
    Disconnect.request primitive and to request an abrupt release. The service provider
    will process the request, stop the two data streams and deliver the Disconnect.indication
    primitive to the remote user as soon as possible. As illustrated in the figure
    below, this abrupt connection release may cause losses of SDUs.

- en: To ensure a reliable delivery of the SDUs sent by each user over a connection,
    we need to consider the two streams that compose a connection as independent.
    A user should be able to release the stream that it uses to send SDUs once it
    has sent all the SDUs that it planned to send over this connection, but still
    continue to receive SDUs over the opposite stream. This graceful connection release
    is usually performed as shown in the figure below. One user issues a Disconnect.request
    primitive to its provider once it has issued all its Data.request primitives.
    The service provider will wait until all Data.indication primitives have been
    delivered to the receiving user before issuing the Disconnnect.indication primitive.
    This primitive informs the receiving user that it will no longer receive SDUs
    over this connection, but it is still able to issue Data.request primitives on
    the stream in the opposite direction. Once the user has issued all of its Data.request
    primitives, it issues a Disconnnect.request primitive to request the termination
    of the remaining stream. The service provider will process the request and deliver
    the corresponding Disconnect.indication to the other user once it has delivered
    all the pending Data.indication primitives. At this point, all data has been delivered,
    the two streams have been released successfully and the connection is completely
    closed.

    A connection-oriented service can only guarantee the correct delivery of all SDUs
    provided that the connection has been released gracefully. This implies that while
    the connection is active, there is no guarantee for the actual delivery of the
    SDUs exchanged as the connection may need to be abruptly released at any time.

- en: The second transport service is the connection-oriented service. On the Internet,
    this service is often called the byte-stream service as it creates a reliable
    byte stream between the two applications that are linked by a transport connection.
    Like the datagram service, the networked applications that use the byte-stream
    service are identified by the host on which they run and a port number. These
    hosts can be identified by an address or a name. [Fig. 13](#fig-co-transport)
    illustrates two applications that are using the byte-stream service provided by
    the TCP protocol on IPv6 hosts. The byte-stream service provided by TCP is reliable
    and bidirectional.

- en: The request-response service is a compromise between the connectionless service
    and the connection-oriented service. Many applications need to send a small amount
    of data and receive a small amount of information back. This is similar to procedure
    calls in programming languages. A call to a procedure takes a few arguments and
    returns a simple answer. In a network, it is sometimes useful to execute a procedure
    on a different host and receive the result of the computation. Executing a procedure
    on another host is often called Remote Procedure Call. It is possible to use the
    connectionless service for this application. However, since this service is usually
    unreliable, this would force the application to deal with any type of error that
    could occur. Using the connection oriented service is another alternative. This
    service ensures the reliable delivery of the data, but a connection must be created
    before the beginning of the data transfer. This overhead can be important for
    applications that only exchange a small amount of data.

    allows several applications running on a host to exchange SDUs with several other
    applications running on remote hosts. Let us consider two hosts, e.g. a client
    and a server. The network layer service allows the client to send information
    to the server, but if an application running on the client wants to contact a
    particular application running on the server, then an additional addressing mechanism
    is required. The network layer address identifies a host, but it is not sufficient
    to differentiate the applications running on a host. Port numbers provides this
    additional addressing. When a server application is launched on a host, it registers
    a port number. This port number will be used by the clients to contact the server
    process.

- en: The figure below shows a typical usage of port numbers. The client process uses
    port number 1234 while the server process uses port number 5678. When the client
    sends a request, it is identified as originating from port number 1234 on the
    client host and destined to port number 5678 on the server host. When the server
    process replies to this request, the server’s transport layer returns the reply
    as originating from port 5678 on the server host and destined to port 1234 on
    the client host.

- en: Compared to the connectionless network layer service, the main advantage of
    the UDP service is that it allows several applications running on a host to exchange
    SDUs with several other applications running on remote hosts. Let us consider
    two hosts, e.g. a client and a server. The network layer service allows the client
    to send information to the server, but if an application running on the client
    wants to contact a particular application running on the server, then an additional
    addressing mechanism is required other than the IP address that identifies a host,
    in order to differentiate the application running on a host. This additional addressing
    is provided by port numbers. When a server using UDP is enabled on a host, this
    server registers a port number. This port number will be used by the clients to
    contact the server process via UDP.

- en: Figure [Fig. 17](#fig-udp-port) shows a typical usage of the UDP port numbers.
    The client process uses port number 1234, while the server process uses port number
    5678\. When the client sends a request, it is identified as originating from port
    number 1234 on the client host and destined to port number 5678 on the server
    host. When the server process replies to this request, the server’s UDP implementation
    will send the reply as originating from port 5678 on the server host and destined
    to port 1234 on the client host.

    The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](../glossary.html#term-Internet-Assigned-Numbers-Authority)
    (IANA) maintains a [registry of the assigned Internet Protocol numbers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)

    applications where delay must be minimized or losses can be recovered by the application
    itself. A first-class of UDP-based applications are applications where the client
    sends a short request and expects a quick and short answer. The [DNS](../glossary.html#term-DNS)
    is an example of a UDP application that is often used in the wide area. However,
    in local area networks, many distributed systems rely on Remote Procedure Call
    ([RPC](../glossary.html#term-RPC)) that is often used on top of UDP. In Unix environments,
    the Network File System ([NFS](../glossary.html#term-NFS)) is built on top of
    RPC and runs frequently on top of UDP. A second class of UDP-based applications
    are the interactive computer games that need to frequently exchange small messages,
    such as the player’s location or their recent actions. Many of these games use
    UDP to minimize the delay and can recover from losses. A third class of applications
    are multimedia applications such as interactive Voice over IP or interactive Video
    over IP. These interactive applications expect a delay shorter than about 200
    milliseconds between the sender and the receiver and can recover from losses directly
    inside the application.

    a basis to understand how hosts communicate. From a computer science viewpoint,
    dealing with voltages is unusual. Computer scientists frequently rely on models
    that enable them to reason about the issues that they face without having to consider
    all implementation details. The physical transmission scheme described above can
    be represented by using a time-sequence diagram.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A time-sequence diagram describes the interactions between communicating hosts.
    By convention, the communicating hosts are represented in the left and right parts
    of the diagram, while the electrical link occupies the middle of the diagram.
    In such a time-sequence diagram, time flows from the top to the bottom of the
    diagram. The transmission of one bit of information is represented by three arrows.
    Starting from the left, the first horizontal arrow represents the request to transmit
    one bit of information. This request is represented by a primitive, which can
    be considered as a kind of procedure call. This primitive has one parameter (the
    bit being transmitted) and a name (DATA.request in this example). By convention,
    all primitives that are named something.request correspond to a request to transmit
    some information. The dashed arrow indicates the transmission of the corresponding
    electrical signal on the wire. Electrical and optical signals do not travel instantaneously.
    The diagonal dashed arrow indicates that it takes some time for the electrical
    signal to be transmitted from Host A to Host B. Upon reception of the electrical
    signal, the electronics on Host B’s network interface detect the voltage and convert
    it into a bit. This bit is delivered as a DATA.indication primitive. All primitives
    that are named something.indication correspond to the reception of some information.
    The dashed lines also represent the relationship between two (or more) primitives.
    Such a time-sequence diagram provides information about the ordering of the different
    primitives, but the distance between two primitives does not represent a precise
    amount of time.

    of a given communication scheme. When considering the above transmission scheme,
    it is useful to evaluate whether this scheme allows the two communicating hosts
    to reliably exchange information. A digital transmission is considered reliable
    when a sequence of bits that is transmitted by a host is received correctly at
    the other end of the wire. In practice, achieving perfect reliability when transmitting
    information using the above scheme is difficult. Several problems can occur with
    such a transmission scheme.
  prefs: []

    interference. Interference can have various sources including natural phenomena
    (like thunderstorms, variations of the magnetic field,…) but also other electrical
    signals (such as interference from neighboring cables, interference from neighboring
    antennas,…). Due to these various types of interference, there is unfortunately
    no guarantee that when a host transmits one bit on a wire, the same bit is received
    at the other end. This is illustrated in the figure below where a DATA.request(0)
    on the left host leads to a Data.indication(1) on the right host.

- en: With the above transmission scheme, a bit is transmitted by setting the voltage
    on the electrical cable to a specific value during some period of time. We have
    seen that due to electromagnetic interference, the voltage measured by the receiver
    can differ from the voltage set by the transmitter. This is the main cause of
    transmission errors. However, this is not the only type of problem that can occur.
    Besides defining the voltages for bits 0 and 1, the above transmission scheme
    also specifies the duration of each bit. If one million bits are sent every second,
    then each bit lasts 1 microsecond. On each host, the transmission (resp. the reception)
    of each bit is triggered by a local clock having a 1 MHz frequency. These clocks
    are the second source of problems when transmitting bits over a wire. Although
    the two clocks have the same specification, they run on different hosts, possibly
    at a different temperature and with a different source of energy. In practice,
    it is possible that the two clocks do not operate at exactly the same frequency.
    Assume that the clock of the transmitting host operates at exactly 1000000 Hz
    while the receiving clock operates at 999999 Hz. This is a very small difference
    between the two clocks. However, when using the clock to transmit bits, this difference
    is important. With its 1000000 Hz clock, the transmitting host will generate one
    million bits during a period of one second. During the same period, the receiving
    host will sense the wire 999999 times and thus will receive one bit less than
    the bits originally transmitted. This small difference in clock frequencies implies
    that bits can “disappear” during their transmission on an electrical cable. This
    is illustrated in the figure below.

    an electrical cable. All physical layers are able to send and receive physical
    symbols that represent values 0 and 1. However, for various reasons that are outside
    the scope of this chapter, several physical layers exchange other physical symbols
    as well. For example, the Manchester encoding used in several physical layers
    can send four different symbols. The Manchester encoding is a differential encoding
    scheme in which time is divided into fixed-length periods. Each period is divided
    into two halves and two different voltage levels can be applied. To send a symbol,
    the sender must set one of these two voltage levels during each half period. To
    send a 1 (resp. 0), the sender must set a high (resp. low) voltage during the
    first half of the period and a low (resp. high) voltage during the second half.
    This encoding ensures that there will be a transition at the middle of each period
    and allows the receiver to synchronize its clock to the sender’s clock. Apart
    from the encodings for 0 and 1, the Manchester encoding also supports two additional
    symbols : InvH and InvB where the same voltage level is used for the two half
    periods. By definition, these two symbols cannot appear inside a frame which is
    only composed of 0 and 1. Some technologies use these special symbols as markers
    for the beginning or end of frames. This encoding is illustrated in [Fig. 2](#fig-manchester).'

    bit strings containing N bits. To allow the receiver to detect a transmission
    error, the sender converts each string of N bits into a string of N+r bits. Usually,
    the r redundant bits are added at the beginning or the end of the transmitted
    bit string, but some techniques interleave redundant bits with the original bits.
    An error detection code can be defined as a function that computes the r redundant
    bits corresponding to each string of N bits. The simplest error detection code
    is the parity bit. There are two types of parity schemes : even and odd parity.
    With the even (resp. odd) parity scheme, the redundant bit is chosen so that an
    even (resp. odd) number of bits are set to 1 in the transmitted bit string of
    N+r bits. The receiver can easily recompute the parity of each received bit string
    and discard the strings with an invalid parity. The parity scheme is often used
    when 7-bit characters are exchanged. In this case, the eighth bit is often a parity
    bit. The table below shows the parity bits that are computed for bit strings containing

    a single bit among the transmitted N+r bits. If there are two or more bits in

    More powerful error detection schemes have been defined. The Cyclical Redundancy
    Checks (CRC) are widely used in datalink layer protocols. An N-bits CRC can detect
    all transmission errors affecting a burst of less than N bits in the transmitted
    frame and all transmission errors that affect an odd number of bits. Additional

    errors. The simplest error correction code is the triple modular redundancy (TMR).
    To transmit a bit set to 1 (resp. 0), the sender transmits 111 (resp. 000). When
    there are no transmission errors, the receiver can decode 111 as 1. If transmission
    errors have affected a single bit, the receiver performs majority voting as shown
    in the table below. This scheme allows the receiver to correct all transmission

    typically divided into several layers as well. Hard-disks store sectors of 512
    bytes or more. Unix filesystems group sectors in larger blocks that can contain

    each block of data from the bit stream despite the imperfections of the physical
    layer. In many networks, the basic unit of information exchanged between two directly

    corresponds to the characteristics of a given transmission medium or receiver.
    For example, the human ear is able to decode sounds in roughly the 0-20 KHz frequency

    ensures that there will never be six consecutive 1 symbols transmitted by the
    physical layer inside a frame. With bit stuffing, a frame is sent as follows.
    First, the sender transmits the marker, i.e. 01111110. Then, it sends all the
    bits of the frame and inserts an additional bit set to 0 after each sequence of
    five consecutive 1 bits. This ensures that the sent frame never contains a sequence
    of six consecutive bits set to 1. As a consequence, the marker pattern cannot
    appear inside the frame sent. The marker is also sent to mark the end of the frame.
    The receiver performs the opposite to decode a received frame. It first detects
    the beginning of the frame thanks to the 01111110 marker. Then, it processes the
    received bits and counts the number of consecutive bits set to 1. If a 0 follows
    five consecutive bits set to 1, this bit is removed since it was inserted by the
    sender. If a 1 follows five consecutive bits set to 1, it indicates a marker if
    it is followed by a bit set to 0. The table below illustrates the application

    the transmitted frame. The receiver detects the frame boundaries and removes the
    second DLE when it receives two consecutive DLE characters. For example, to transmit
    frame 1 2 3 DLE STX 4, a sender will first send DLE STX as a marker, followed
    by 1 2 3 DLE. Then, the sender transmits an additional DLE character followed
    by STX 4 and the DLE ETX marker.

    even recover from transmission errors. To allow a receiver to notice transmission
    errors, a sender must add some redundant information as an error detection code
    to the frame sent. This error detection code is computed by the sender on the
    frame that it transmits. When the receiver receives a frame with an error detection
    code, it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code
    matches the computed error detection code. If they match, the frame is considered
    to be valid.

    idle for some time after the transmission of each frame. These idle periods can
    be detected by the receiver and serve as a marker to delineate frame boundaries.
    Unfortunately, this solution is not acceptable for two reasons. First, some physical

    an idle period between frames decreases the maximum bit rate that can be achieved.

    of the physical service. The original definition of [bandwidth](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/bandwidth),
    as listed in the [Webster dictionary](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary)
    is a range of radio frequencies which is occupied by a modulated carrier wave,
    which is assigned to a service, or over which a device can operate. This definition
    corresponds to the characteristics of a given transmission medium or receiver.
    For example, the human ear is able to decode sounds in roughly the 0-20 KHz frequency
    range. By extension, bandwidth is also used to represent the capacity of a communication
    system in bits per second. For example, a Gigabit Ethernet link is theoretically
    capable of transporting one billion bits per second.

    generic solution which can be used with any physical layer that is able to transmit

    and two variants exist : bit stuffing and character stuffing. To enable a receiver

    bit strings do not appear inside the frames.'

- en: Bit stuffing reserves the 01111110 bit string as the frame boundary marker and
    ensures that there will never be six consecutive 1 symbols transmitted by the
    physical layer inside a frame. With bit stuffing, a frame is sent as follows.
    First, the sender transmits the marker, i.e. 01111110. Then, it sends all the
    bits of the frame and inserts an additional bit set to 0 after each sequence of
    five consecutive 1 bits. This ensures that the sent frame never contains a sequence
    of six consecutive bits set to 1. As a consequence, the marker pattern cannot
    appear inside the frame sent. The marker is also sent to mark the end of the frame.
    The receiver performs the opposite to decode a received frame. It first detects
    the beginning of the frame thanks to the 01111110 marker. Then, it processes the
    received bits and counts the number of consecutive bits set to 1. If a 0 follows
    five consecutive bits set to 1, this bit is removed since it was inserted by the
    sender. If a 1 follows five consecutive bits set to 1, it indicates a marker if
    it is followed by a bit set to 0. The table below illustrates the application
    of bit stuffing to some frames.

    worst case for bit stuffing is of course a long sequence of bits set to 1 inside
    the frame. If transmission errors occur, stuffed bits or markers can be in error.
    In these cases, the frame affected by the error and possibly the next frame will
    not be correctly decoded by the receiver, but it will be able to resynchronize
    itself at the next valid marker.

    transmitted DLE character. This ensures that none of the markers can appear inside

    even recover from transmission errors. To allow a receiver to notice transmission
    errors, a sender must add some redundant information as an error detection code
    to the frame sent. This error detection code is computed by the sender on the
    frame that it transmits. When the receiver receives a frame with an error detection
    code, it recomputes it and verifies whether the received error detection code
    matches the computed error detection code. If they match, the frame is considered
    to be valid.

    to the same physical medium. This is the task of the network layer. The network
    layer is built above the datalink layer. Network layer entities exchange packets.
    A packet is a finite sequence of bytes that is transported by the datalink layer
    inside one or more frames. A packet usually contains information about its origin
    and its destination, and usually passes through several intermediate devices called
    routers on its way from its origin to its destination. This is illustrated in
    [Fig. 5](#fig-network-layer).

    flow between two given hosts is the task of the transport layer. Transport layer
    entities exchange segments. A segment is a finite sequence of bytes that are transported
    inside one or more packets. A transport layer entity issues segments (or sometimes

    the operations of the network layer. This layer is able to deliver packets to
    their intended destination, but it cannot guarantee their delivery. The main cause
    of packet losses and errors are the buffers used on the network nodes. If the
    buffers of one of these nodes becomes full, all arriving packets must be discarded.
    This situation frequently happens in practice. Transmission errors can also affect
    packet transmissions on links where reliable transmission techniques are not enabled

    where the service provider guarantees that all SDUs submitted in Data.requests
    by a user will eventually be delivered to their destination. Such a service would
    be very useful for users, but guaranteeing perfect delivery is difficult in practice.
    For this reason, network layers usually support an unreliable connectionless service.

- en: An invocation of the connection-oriented service is divided into three phases.
    The first phase is the establishment of a connection. A connection is a temporary
    association between two users through a service provider. Several connections
    may exist at the same time between any pair of users. Once established, the connection
    is used to transfer SDUs. Connections usually provide one bidirectional stream
    supporting the exchange of SDUs between the two users that are associated through
    the connection. This stream is used to transfer data during the second phase of
    the connection called the data transfer phase. The third phase is the termination
    of the connection. Once the users have finished exchanging SDUs, they request
    the service provider to terminate the connection. As we will see later, there
    are also some cases where the service provider may need to terminate a connection
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The establishment of a connection can be modeled by using four primitives :
    Connect.request, Connect.indication, Connect.response and Connect.confirm. The
    Connect.request primitive is used to request the establishment of a connection.
    The main parameter of this primitive is the address of the destination user. The
    service provider delivers a Connect.indication primitive to inform the destination
    user of the connection attempt. If it accepts to establish a connection, it responds
    with a Connect.response primitive. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be established and the destination user can start sending SDUs over the connection.
    The service provider processes the Connect.response and will deliver a Connect.confirm
    to the user who initiated the connection. The delivery of this primitive terminates
    the connection establishment phase. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be open and both users can send SDUs. A successful connection establishment
    is illustrated below.'

- en: The example above shows a successful connection establishment. However, in practice
    not all connections are successfully established. One reason is that the destination
    user may not agree, for policy or performance reasons, to establish a connection
    with the initiating user at this time. In this case, the destination user responds
    to the Connect.indication primitive by a Disconnect.request primitive that contains
    a parameter to indicate why the connection has been refused. The service provider
    will then deliver a Disconnect.indication primitive to inform the initiating user.

- en: Once the connection has been established, the service provider supplies two
    data streams to the communicating users. The first data stream can be used by
    the initiating user to send SDUs. The second data stream allows the responding
    user to send SDUs to the initiating user. The data streams can be organized in
    different ways. A first organization is the message-mode transfer. With the message-mode
    transfer, the service provider guarantees that one and only one Data.indication
    will be delivered to the endpoint of the data stream for each Data.request primitive
    issued by the other endpoint. The message-mode transfer is illustrated in the
    figure below. The main advantage of the message-transfer mode is that the recipient
    receives exactly the SDUs that were sent by the other user. If each SDU contains
    a command, the receiving user can process each command as soon as it receives
    a SDU.

- en: Unfortunately, the message-mode transfer is not widely used on the Internet.
    On the Internet, the most popular connection-oriented service transfers SDUs in
    stream-mode. With the stream-mode, the service provider supplies a byte stream
    that links the two communicating users. The sending user sends bytes by using
    Data.request primitives that contain sequences of bytes as SDUs. The service provider
    delivers SDUs containing consecutive bytes to the receiving user by using Data.indication
    primitives. The service provider ensures that all the bytes sent at one end of
    the stream are delivered correctly in the same order at the other endpoint. However,
    the service provider does not attempt to preserve the boundaries of the SDUs.
    There is no relation enforced by the service provider between the number of Data.request
    and the number of Data.indication primitives. The stream-mode is illustrated in
    the figure below. In practice, a consequence of the utilization of the stream-mode
    is that if the users want to exchange structured SDUs, they will need to provide
    the mechanisms that allow the receiving user to separate successive SDUs in the
    byte stream that it receives. Application layer protocols often use specific delimiters
    such as the end of line character to delineate SDUs in a bytestream.

- en: The third phase of a connection is its release. As a connection involves three
    parties (two users and one service provider), any of them can request the termination
    of the connection. Usually, connections are terminated upon request of one user
    once the data transfer is finished. However, sometimes the service provider may
    be forced to terminate a connection. This can be due to lack of resources inside
    the service provider or because one of the users is not reachable anymore through
    the network. In this case, the service provider will issue Disconnect.indication
    primitives to both users. These primitives will contain, as parameter, some information
    about the reason for the termination of the connection. Unfortunately, as illustrated
    in the figure below, when a service provider is forced to terminate a connection
    it cannot guarantee that all SDUs sent by each user have been delivered to the
    other user. This connection release is said to be abrupt as it can cause losses
    of data.

    user needs, for any reason, to terminate a connection quickly, it can issue a
    Disconnect.request primitive and to request an abrupt release. The service provider
    will process the request, stop the two data streams and deliver the Disconnect.indication
    primitive to the remote user as soon as possible. As illustrated in the figure

- en: To ensure a reliable delivery of the SDUs sent by each user over a connection,
    we need to consider the two streams that compose a connection as independent.
    A user should be able to release the stream that it uses to send SDUs once it
    has sent all the SDUs that it planned to send over this connection, but still
    continue to receive SDUs over the opposite stream. This graceful connection release
    is usually performed as shown in the figure below. One user issues a Disconnect.request
    primitive to its provider once it has issued all its Data.request primitives.
    The service provider will wait until all Data.indication primitives have been
    delivered to the receiving user before issuing the Disconnnect.indication primitive.
    This primitive informs the receiving user that it will no longer receive SDUs
    over this connection, but it is still able to issue Data.request primitives on
    the stream in the opposite direction. Once the user has issued all of its Data.request
    primitives, it issues a Disconnnect.request primitive to request the termination
    of the remaining stream. The service provider will process the request and deliver
    the corresponding Disconnect.indication to the other user once it has delivered
    all the pending Data.indication primitives. At this point, all data has been delivered,
    the two streams have been released successfully and the connection is completely
    closed.

    A connection-oriented service can only guarantee the correct delivery of all SDUs
    provided that the connection has been released gracefully. This implies that while
    the connection is active, there is no guarantee for the actual delivery of the
    SDUs exchanged as the connection may need to be abruptly released at any time.

    this service is often called the byte-stream service as it creates a reliable
    byte stream between the two applications that are linked by a transport connection.
    Like the datagram service, the networked applications that use the byte-stream
    service are identified by the host on which they run and a port number. These
    hosts can be identified by an address or a name. [Fig. 13](#fig-co-transport)
    illustrates two applications that are using the byte-stream service provided by
    the TCP protocol on IPv6 hosts. The byte-stream service provided by TCP is reliable
    and bidirectional.

- en: The request-response service is a compromise between the connectionless service
    and the connection-oriented service. Many applications need to send a small amount
    of data and receive a small amount of information back. This is similar to procedure
    calls in programming languages. A call to a procedure takes a few arguments and
    returns a simple answer. In a network, it is sometimes useful to execute a procedure
    on a different host and receive the result of the computation. Executing a procedure
    on another host is often called Remote Procedure Call. It is possible to use the
    connectionless service for this application. However, since this service is usually
    unreliable, this would force the application to deal with any type of error that
    could occur. Using the connection oriented service is another alternative. This
    service ensures the reliable delivery of the data, but a connection must be created
    before the beginning of the data transfer. This overhead can be important for
    applications that only exchange a small amount of data.

    transport layer. However, it is important to note that the notion of service is
    more general than in the transport layer. As explained earlier, the network layer
    also provides a service, which in most networks is an unreliable connectionless
    service. There are network layers that provide a connection-oriented service.
    Similarly, the datalink layer also provides services. Some datalink layers will
    provide a connectionless service. This will be the case in Local Area Networks
    for examples. Other datalink layers, e.g. in public networks, provide a connection
    oriented service.

- en: There are several possible implementations of the connectionless service. Before
    studying these realizations, it is useful to discuss the possible characteristics
    of the connectionless service. A reliable connectionless service is a service
    where the service provider guarantees that all SDUs submitted in Data.requests
    by a user will eventually be delivered to their destination. Such a service would
    be very useful for users, but guaranteeing perfect delivery is difficult in practice.
    For this reason, network layers usually support an unreliable connectionless service.

    compared to a reliable connectionless service. First of all, an unreliable connectionless
    service does not guarantee the delivery of all SDUs. This can be expressed graphically

    The first phase is the establishment of a connection. A connection is a temporary
    association between two users through a service provider. Several connections
    may exist at the same time between any pair of users. Once established, the connection
    is used to transfer SDUs. Connections usually provide one bidirectional stream
    supporting the exchange of SDUs between the two users that are associated through
    the connection. This stream is used to transfer data during the second phase of
    the connection called the data transfer phase. The third phase is the termination
    of the connection. Once the users have finished exchanging SDUs, they request
    the service provider to terminate the connection. As we will see later, there
    are also some cases where the service provider may need to terminate a connection
    itself.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 'The establishment of a connection can be modeled by using four primitives :
    Connect.request, Connect.indication, Connect.response and Connect.confirm. The
    Connect.request primitive is used to request the establishment of a connection.
    The main parameter of this primitive is the address of the destination user. The
    service provider delivers a Connect.indication primitive to inform the destination
    user of the connection attempt. If it accepts to establish a connection, it responds
    with a Connect.response primitive. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be established and the destination user can start sending SDUs over the connection.
    The service provider processes the Connect.response and will deliver a Connect.confirm
    to the user who initiated the connection. The delivery of this primitive terminates
    the connection establishment phase. At this point, the connection is considered
    to be open and both users can send SDUs. A successful connection establishment

- en: Once the connection has been established, the service provider supplies two
    data streams to the communicating users. The first data stream can be used by
    the initiating user to send SDUs. The second data stream allows the responding
    user to send SDUs to the initiating user. The data streams can be organized in
    different ways. A first organization is the message-mode transfer. With the message-mode
    transfer, the service provider guarantees that one and only one Data.indication
    will be delivered to the endpoint of the data stream for each Data.request primitive
    issued by the other endpoint. The message-mode transfer is illustrated in the
    figure below. The main advantage of the message-transfer mode is that the recipient
    receives exactly the SDUs that were sent by the other user. If each SDU contains
    a command, the receiving user can process each command as soon as it receives
    a SDU.

- en: Unfortunately, the message-mode transfer is not widely used on the Internet.
    On the Internet, the most popular connection-oriented service transfers SDUs in
    stream-mode. With the stream-mode, the service provider supplies a byte stream
    that links the two communicating users. The sending user sends bytes by using
    Data.request primitives that contain sequences of bytes as SDUs. The service provider
    delivers SDUs containing consecutive bytes to the receiving user by using Data.indication
    primitives. The service provider ensures that all the bytes sent at one end of
    the stream are delivered correctly in the same order at the other endpoint. However,
    the service provider does not attempt to preserve the boundaries of the SDUs.
    There is no relation enforced by the service provider between the number of Data.request
    and the number of Data.indication primitives. The stream-mode is illustrated in
    the figure below. In practice, a consequence of the utilization of the stream-mode
    is that if the users want to exchange structured SDUs, they will need to provide
    the mechanisms that allow the receiving user to separate successive SDUs in the
    byte stream that it receives. Application layer protocols often use specific delimiters
    such as the end of line character to delineate SDUs in a bytestream.

- en: The third phase of a connection is its release. As a connection involves three
    parties (two users and one service provider), any of them can request the termination
    of the connection. Usually, connections are terminated upon request of one user
    once the data transfer is finished. However, sometimes the service provider may
    be forced to terminate a connection. This can be due to lack of resources inside
    the service provider or because one of the users is not reachable anymore through
    the network. In this case, the service provider will issue Disconnect.indication
    primitives to both users. These primitives will contain, as parameter, some information
    about the reason for the termination of the connection. Unfortunately, as illustrated
    in the figure below, when a service provider is forced to terminate a connection
    it cannot guarantee that all SDUs sent by each user have been delivered to the
    other user. This connection release is said to be abrupt as it can cause losses
    of data.

- en: An abrupt connection release can also be triggered by one of the users. If a
    user needs, for any reason, to terminate a connection quickly, it can issue a
    Disconnect.request primitive and to request an abrupt release. The service provider
    will process the request, stop the two data streams and deliver the Disconnect.indication
    primitive to the remote user as soon as possible. As illustrated in the figure
    below, this abrupt connection release may cause losses of SDUs.

- en: To ensure a reliable delivery of the SDUs sent by each user over a connection,
    we need to consider the two streams that compose a connection as independent.
    A user should be able to release the stream that it uses to send SDUs once it
    has sent all the SDUs that it planned to send over this connection, but still
    continue to receive SDUs over the opposite stream. This graceful connection release
    is usually performed as shown in the figure below. One user issues a Disconnect.request
    primitive to its provider once it has issued all its Data.request primitives.
    The service provider will wait until all Data.indication primitives have been
    delivered to the receiving user before issuing the Disconnnect.indication primitive.
    This primitive informs the receiving user that it will no longer receive SDUs
    over this connection, but it is still able to issue Data.request primitives on
    the stream in the opposite direction. Once the user has issued all of its Data.request
    primitives, it issues a Disconnnect.request primitive to request the termination
    of the remaining stream. The service provider will process the request and deliver
    the corresponding Disconnect.indication to the other user once it has delivered
    all the pending Data.indication primitives. At this point, all data has been delivered,
    the two streams have been released successfully and the connection is completely
    closed.

    A connection-oriented service can only guarantee the correct delivery of all SDUs
    provided that the connection has been released gracefully. This implies that while
    the connection is active, there is no guarantee for the actual delivery of the
    SDUs exchanged as the connection may need to be abruptly released at any time.

- en: The second transport service is the connection-oriented service. On the Internet,
    this service is often called the byte-stream service as it creates a reliable
    byte stream between the two applications that are linked by a transport connection.
    Like the datagram service, the networked applications that use the byte-stream
    service are identified by the host on which they run and a port number. These
    hosts can be identified by an address or a name. [Fig. 13](#fig-co-transport)
    illustrates two applications that are using the byte-stream service provided by
    the TCP protocol on IPv6 hosts. The byte-stream service provided by TCP is reliable
    and bidirectional.

- en: The request-response service is a compromise between the connectionless service
    and the connection-oriented service. Many applications need to send a small amount
    of data and receive a small amount of information back. This is similar to procedure
    calls in programming languages. A call to a procedure takes a few arguments and
    returns a simple answer. In a network, it is sometimes useful to execute a procedure
    on a different host and receive the result of the computation. Executing a procedure
    on another host is often called Remote Procedure Call. It is possible to use the
    connectionless service for this application. However, since this service is usually
    unreliable, this would force the application to deal with any type of error that
    could occur. Using the connection oriented service is another alternative. This
    service ensures the reliable delivery of the data, but a connection must be created
    before the beginning of the data transfer. This overhead can be important for
    applications that only exchange a small amount of data.

    additional addressing. When a server application is launched on a host, it registers
    a port number. This port number will be used by the clients to contact the server
    process.

    client host and destined to port number 5678 on the server host. When the server
    process replies to this request, the server’s transport layer returns the reply
    as originating from port 5678 on the server host and destined to port 1234 on

    applications where delay must be minimized or losses can be recovered by the application
    itself. A first-class of UDP-based applications are applications where the client
    sends a short request and expects a quick and short answer. The [DNS](../glossary.html#term-DNS)
    is an example of a UDP application that is often used in the wide area. However,
    in local area networks, many distributed systems rely on Remote Procedure Call
    ([RPC](../glossary.html#term-RPC)) that is often used on top of UDP. In Unix environments,
    the Network File System ([NFS](../glossary.html#term-NFS)) is built on top of
    RPC and runs frequently on top of UDP. A second class of UDP-based applications
    are the interactive computer games that need to frequently exchange small messages,
    such as the player’s location or their recent actions. Many of these games use
    UDP to minimize the delay and can recover from losses. A third class of applications
    are multimedia applications such as interactive Voice over IP or interactive Video
    over IP. These interactive applications expect a delay shorter than about 200
    milliseconds between the sender and the receiver and can recover from losses directly
    inside the application.

    can be bound to port numbers smaller than 1024. Well-known servers such as [DNS](../glossary.html#term-DNS),
    [NNTP](../glossary.html#term-NNTP),or [RPC](../glossary.html#term-RPC) use privileged
    port numbers. When a client needs to use UDP, it usually does not require a specific
    port number. In this case, the UDP implementation will allocate the first available
    port number in the ephemeral range. The range of registered port numbers should
    be used by servers. In theory, developers of network servers should register their
    port number officially through IANA [[3]](#fportnum), but few developers do this.

- en: UDP can be used over IPv4 or IPv6\. When a host receives an IP packet, it needs
    to determine whether this packet should be processed by UDP or another transport
    protocol. This is done by using the Protocol field in the IP version 4 header.
    The [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority](../glossary.html#term-Internet-Assigned-Numbers-Authority)
    (IANA) maintains a [registry of the assigned Internet Protocol numbers](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml)
    that assigns one integer to each protocol which can be carried inside an IP packet.
    This registry specifies that `17` is reserved to indicate a UDP segment. Figure
    [Fig. 19](#fig-udp-ipv4) shows a UDP segment inside an IPv4 packet.

- en: Many Internet protocols use the Internet checksum defined in [**RFC 1071**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1071.html)
    to detect transmission errors. This checksum is computed by the sender and verified
    by the received. The algorithm defined in [**RFC 1071**](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc1071.html)
    uses modular arithmetic. It is computed over a sequence of bytes which is padded
    if it contains an odd number of bytes. The checksum is the one’s complement of
    the sum of the 16 bits words modulo \(2^16\). The python code below computes the
    Internet checksum.

- en: Several types of applications rely on UDP. As a rule of thumb, UDP is used for
    applications where delay must be minimized or losses can be recovered by the application
    itself. A first-class of UDP-based applications are applications where the client
    sends a short request and expects a quick and short answer. The [DNS](../glossary.html#term-DNS)
    is an example of a UDP application that is often used in the wide area. However,
    in local area networks, many distributed systems rely on Remote Procedure Call
    ([RPC](../glossary.html#term-RPC)) that is often used on top of UDP. In Unix environments,
    the Network File System ([NFS](../glossary.html#term-NFS)) is built on top of
    RPC and runs frequently on top of UDP. A second class of UDP-based applications
    are the interactive computer games that need to frequently exchange small messages,
    such as the player’s location or their recent actions. Many of these games use
    UDP to minimize the delay and can recover from losses. A third class of applications
    are multimedia applications such as interactive Voice over IP or interactive Video
    over IP. These interactive applications expect a delay shorter than about 200
    milliseconds between the sender and the receiver and can recover from losses directly
    inside the application.
