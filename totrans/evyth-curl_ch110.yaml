- en: Unix systems have for a long time offered a way for users to store their user
    name and password for remote FTP servers. ftp clients have supported this for
    decades and this way allowed users to quickly login to known servers without manually
    having to reenter the credentials each time. The `.netrc` file is typically stored
    in a user’s home directory. (On Windows, curl looks for it with the name `_netrc`).

- en: This being a widespread and well used concept, curl also supports it—if you
    ask it to. curl does not, however, limit this feature to FTP, but can get credentials
    for machines for any protocol with this. See further below for how.

    Since 7.84.0, curl also supports quoted strings. They start and end with double
    quotes (`"`) and support the escaped special letters `\"`, (newline), (carriage
    return), and (TAB). Quoted strings are the only way a space character can be used
    in a username or password.

    token that matches the remote machine specified in the URL. Once a match is made,
    the subsequent .netrc tokens are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached
    or another machine is encountered.

    if the remote server requires a password as part of the login process. Note that
    if this token is present in the .netrc file you really **should** make sure the
    file is not readable by anyone besides the user. You cannot use a space when you
    enter the password.

    the `.netrc` to still work fine, curl properly skips every definition done with
    `macdef` that it finds.
