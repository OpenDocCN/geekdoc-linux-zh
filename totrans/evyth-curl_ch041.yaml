  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: No information should be made public about a vulnerability until it is formally
    announced at the end of this process. That means, for example, that a bug tracker
    entry must NOT be created to track the issue since that makes the issue public
    and it should not be discussed on any of the project’s public mailing lists. Also
    messages associated with any commits should not make any reference to the security
    nature of the commit if done prior to the public announcement.

- en: The person discovering the issue, the reporter, reports the vulnerability on
    [https://hackerone.com/curl](https://hackerone.com/curl). Issues filed there reach
    a handful of selected and trusted people.

    of the problem and suggests a release schedule. This discussion should involve
    the reporter as much as possible.
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The release of the information should be as soon as possible and is most often
    synced with an upcoming release that contains the fix. If the reporter, or anyone
    else, thinks the next planned release is too far away then a separate earlier
    release for security reasons should be considered.

    we might ask you to join the list or you can ask to join it. It really is not
    formal. We only require that you have a long-term presence in the curl project
    and you have shown an understanding for the project and its way of working. You
    must have been around for a good while and you should have no plans on vanishing
    in the near future.
