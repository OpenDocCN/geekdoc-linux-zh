    still maintain the connection. So, if we figure out that the transfer had better
    stop after the transfer has started, there are only two ways to proceed: cut the
    connection and pay the price of reestablishing the connection again for the next
    request, or keep the transfer going and waste bandwidth but be able to reuse the
    connection next time.'

    only to discover that the server requires authentication and immediately sends
    back a 401 response code.

- en: 'The mitigation that exists to make this scenario less frequent is to have curl
    pass on an extra header, `Expect: 100-continue`, which gives the server a chance
    to deny the request before a lot of data is sent off. curl sends this `Expect:`
    header by default if the POST it does is known or suspected to be larger than
    one megabyte. curl also does this for PUT requests.'

- en: When a server gets a request with an 100-continue and deems the request fine,
    it responds with a 100 response that makes the client continue. If the server
    does not like the request, it sends back response code for the error it thinks
    it is.

    header or do not handle it correctly, so curl only waits 1000 milliseconds for
    that first response before it continues anyway.'

    `--expect100-timeout <seconds>`. You can avoid the wait entirely by using `-H
    Expect:` to remove the header:'

- en: In some situations, curl inhibits the use of the `Expect` header if the content
    it is about to send is small (below one megabyte), as having to waste such a small
    chunk of data is not considered much of a problem.

    down the connection, which makes `Expect:` pointless.
