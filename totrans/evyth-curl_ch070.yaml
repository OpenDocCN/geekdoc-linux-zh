- en: curl has more than two hundred and fifty command-line options and the number
    of options keep increasing over time. Chances are the number of options reaches
    or even surpasses three hundred in the coming years.

- en: To find out which options you need to perform a certain action, you can get
    curl to list them. First, `curl --help` or simply `curl -h` get you a list of
    the most important and frequently used options. You can then provide an additional
    “category” to `-h` to get more options listed for that specific area. Use `curl
    -h category` to list all existing categories or `curl -h all` to list *all* available
    options.

- en: The `curl --manual` option outputs the entire man page for curl. That is a thorough
    and complete document on how each option works amassing several thousand lines
    of documentation. To wade through that is also a tedious work and we encourage
    use of a search function through those text masses. Some people might also appreciate
    the man page in its [web version](https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html).
