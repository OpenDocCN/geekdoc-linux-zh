    the code, redistribute binaries built from the code and build proprietary code
    with it, without anyone requiring you to give any changes back to the project—but
    you may not claim that you wrote it.

    we settled on this. We started out GPL, then tried MPL and landed on this MIT
    derivative. We do not intend to ever change the license again.
