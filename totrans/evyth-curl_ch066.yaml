- en: Setting up a TCP connection and especially a TLS connection can be a slow process,
    even on high bandwidth networks.

- en: It can be useful to remember that curl has a connection pool internally which
    keeps previously used connections alive and around for a while after they were
    used so that subsequent requests to the same hosts can reuse an already established
    connection.

- en: Of course, they can only be kept alive for as long as the curl tool is running.
    It is a good reason for trying to get several transfers done within the same command
    line instead of running several independent curl command line invocations.
