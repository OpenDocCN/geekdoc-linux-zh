    an excellent help to figure out what went wrong in a particular transfer and often
    explains why it can be done like that or what the problem is for the moment.

- en: When libcurl is told to be verbose it outputs transfer-related details and information
    to stderr while the transfer is ongoing. This is awesome to figure out why things
    fail and to learn exactly what libcurl does when you ask it different things.
    You can redirect the output elsewhere by changing stderr with `CURLOPT_STDERR`
    or you can get even more info in a fancier way with the debug callback (explained
    further in a later section).

- en: Verbose is certainly fine, but sometimes you need more. libcurl also offers
    a trace callback that in addition to showing you all the stuff the verbose mode
    does, it also passes on *all* data sent and received so that your application
    gets a full trace of everything.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The sent and received data passed to the trace callback is given to the callback
    in its unencrypted form, which can be handy when working with TLS or SSH based
    protocols when capturing the data off the network for debugging is not practical.

    enabled but with the trace callback set libcurl uses that callback instead of
    its internal handling.

- en: As the trace information flow passed to the debug callback is a continuous stream
    even though your application might make libcurl use a large number of separate
    connections and different transfers, there are times when you want to see to which
    specific transfers or connections the various information belong to. To better
