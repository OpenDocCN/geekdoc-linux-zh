- en: This callback function gets called by libcurl as soon as a header has been received.
    *ptr* points to the delivered data, and the size of that data is *size* multiplied
    with *nmemb*. libcurl buffers headers and delivers only “full” headers, one by
    one, to this callback.

    example, use printf’s `%s` operator to display the contents nor strcpy to copy
    it.

- en: This callback should return the number of bytes actually taken care of. If that
    number differs from the number passed to your callback function, it signals an
    error condition to the library. This causes the transfer to abort and the libcurl
    function used returns `CURLE_WRITE_ERROR`.
