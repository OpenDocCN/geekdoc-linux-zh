# Network and protocols

Before diving in and talking about how to use curl to get things done, let’s take a look at what all this networking is and how it works, using simplifications and some minor shortcuts to give an easy overview.

The basics are in the [networking simplified](ch021.xhtml#protocols__network__md) chapter that tries to just draw a simple picture of what networking is from a curl perspective, and the [protocols](ch022.xhtml#protocols__protocols__md) section which explains what exactly a “protocol” is and how that works.
