<p>curl has more than two hundred and fifty command-line options and the number of options keep increasing over time. Chances are the number of options reaches or even surpasses three hundred in the coming years.</p>
<p>To find out which options you need to perform a certain action, you can get curl to list them. First, <code>curl --help</code> or simply <code>curl -h</code> get you a list of the most important and frequently used options. You can then provide an additional “category” to <code>-h</code> to get more options listed for that specific area. Use <code>curl -h category</code> to list all existing categories or <code>curl -h all</code> to list <em>all</em> available options.</p>
<p>The <code>curl --manual</code> option outputs the entire man page for curl. That is a thorough and complete document on how each option works amassing several thousand lines of documentation. To wade through that is also a tedious work and we encourage use of a search function through those text masses. Some people might also appreciate the man page in its <a href="https://curl.se/docs/manpage.html">web version</a>.</p>
