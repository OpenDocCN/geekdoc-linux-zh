<p>libcurl provides three different ways to perform the transfer. Which way to use in your case is entirely up to you and what you need.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The ‘easy’ interface lets you do a single transfer in a synchronous fashion. libcurl does the entire transfer and return control back to your application when it is completed—successful or failed.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘multi’ interface is for when you want to do more than one transfer at the same time, or you just want a non-blocking transfer.</p></li>
<li><p>The ‘multi_socket’ interface is a slight variation of the regular multi one, but is event-based and is really the suggested API to use if you intend to scale up the number of simultaneous transfers to hundreds or thousands or so.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Let’s look at each one a little closer…</p>
