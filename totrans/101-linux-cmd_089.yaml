- en: The `ssh` command in Linux stands for "Secure Shell". It is a protocol used
    to securely connect to a remote server/system. ssh is more secure in the sense
    that it transfers the data in encrypted form between the host and the client.
    ssh runs at TCP/IP port 22.

    a connection is made to the local port or socket, the connection is forwarded
