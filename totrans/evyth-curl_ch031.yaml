    If you want to upgrade to the latest version shipped by the curl project, we recommend
    installing [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (a macOS software package manager) and
    then install the curl package from them:'

    libcurl together with its associated headers.

    the development environment `XCode` from Apple, you can use libcurl directly without
    having to install anything extra as the curl include files are bundled there.
