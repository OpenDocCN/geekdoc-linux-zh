  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Most transfers libcurl can do involves a name that first needs to be translated
    to an Internet address. That is name resolving. Using a numerical IP address directly
    in the URL usually avoids the name resolve phase, but in many cases it is not
    easy to manually replace the name with the IP address.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: libcurl tries hard to [re-use an existing connection](ch233.xhtml#transfers__conn__reuse__md)
    rather than to create a new one. The function that checks for an existing connection
    to use is based purely on the name and is performed before any name resolving
    is attempted. That is one of the reasons the re-use is so much faster. A transfer
    using a reused connection does not resolve the hostname again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If no connection can be reused, libcurl resolves the hostname to the set of
    addresses it resolves to. Typically this means asking for both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses
    and there may be a whole set of those returned to libcurl. That set of addresses
    is then tried until one works, or it returns failure.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: libcurl can be built to do name resolves in one out of these three different
    ways and depending on which backend way that is used, it gets a slightly different
    feature set and sometimes modified behavior.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The default backend is invoking the normal libc resolver functions in a new
    helper-thread, so that it can still do fine-grained timeouts if wanted and there
    is no blocking calls involved.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On older systems, libcurl uses the standard synchronous name resolver functions.
    They unfortunately make all transfers within a multi handle block during its operation
    and it is much harder to time out nicely.
  prefs:
  - PREF_OL
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There is also support for resolving with the c-ares third party library, which
    supports asynchronous name resolving without the use of threads. This scales better
    to huge number of parallel transfers but it is not always 100% compatible with
    the native name resolver functionality.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Independently of what resolver backend that libcurl is built to use, since 7.62.0
    it also provides a way for the user to ask a specific DoH (DNS over HTTPS) server
    for the address of a name. This avoids using the normal, native resolver method
    and server and instead asks a dedicated separate one.

    that you have HTTP/2 support enabled so that libcurl can perform multiple DoH
    requests multiplexed over the connection to the DoH server.

- en: When a name has been resolved, the result is stored in libcurl’s in-memory cache
    so that subsequent resolves of the same name are instant for as long the name
    is kept in the DNS cache. By default, each entry is kept in the cache for 60 seconds,
    but that value can be changed with `CURLOPT_DNS_CACHE_TIMEOUT`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The DNS cache is kept within the easy handle when `curl_easy_perform` is used,
    or within the multi handle when the multi interface is used. It can also be made
    shared between multiple easy handles using the [share interface](ch257.xhtml#helpers__sharing__md).
