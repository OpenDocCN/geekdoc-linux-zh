  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Creating the easy handle and setting options on it does not make any transfer
    happen, and usually do not even make much more happen other than libcurl storing
    your wish to be used later when the transfer actually occurs. Lots of syntax checking
    and validation of the input may also be postponed, so just because `curl_easy_setopt`
    did not complain, it does not mean that the input was correct and valid; you may
    get an error returned later.

    actual transfer.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The actual performing of the transfer can be done using different methods and
    function calls, depending on what kind of behavior you want in your application
    and how libcurl is best integrated into your architecture. Those are further described
    later in this chapter.

- en: While the transfer is ongoing, libcurl calls your specified functions—known
    as *[callbacks](callbacks/)* — to deliver data, to read data and to do a variety
    of things.

- en: After the transfer has completed, you can figure out if it succeeded or not
    and you can extract statistics and other information that libcurl gathered during
    the transfer from the easy handle. See [Post transfer information](ch243.xhtml#transfers__getinfo__md).

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Easy handles are meant and designed to be reused. When you have done a single
    transfer with the easy handle, you can immediately use it again for your next
    transfer. There are lots of gains to be had by this.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All options are “sticky”. If you make a second transfer with the same handle,
    the same options are used. They remain set in the handle until you change them
    again, or call `curl_easy_reset()` on the handle.

- en: Reset
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: By calling `curl_easy_reset()`, all options for the given easy handle are reset
    and restored to their default values. The same values the options had when the
    handle was initially created. The caches remain intact.

    `curl_easy_duphandle()`. It returns a copy of the handle passed in to it.
