    you want to access.

  zh: 这些不是代理，但它们阻挡了您与您想要访问的服务器之间的道路。
- en: A captive portal is one of these systems that are popular to use in hotels,
    airports and for other sorts of network access to a larger audience. The portal
    captures all network traffic and redirects you to a login webpage until you have
    either clicked OK and verified that you have read their conditions or perhaps
    even made sure that you have paid plenty of money for the right to use the network.

  zh: 门户网关是这类在酒店、机场以及其他面向更广泛受众的网络接入中流行的系统之一。门户网关捕获所有网络流量，并引导您到一个登录网页，直到您点击“确定”并确认您已阅读他们的条款，或者甚至确保您已经支付了足够的费用以获得使用网络的权限。
- en: curl’s traffic is of course also captured by such portals and often the best
    way is to use a browser to accept the conditions and get rid of the portal since
    from then on they often allow all other traffic originating from that same machine
    (MAC address) for a period of time.

  zh: 当然，curl 的流量也会被这样的门户网关捕获，通常最好的办法是使用浏览器接受这些条款，并摆脱门户网关，因为从那时起，它们通常会在一段时间内允许来自同一台机器（MAC地址）的所有其他流量。
- en: Most often you can use curl too to submit that affirmation, if you just figure
    out how to submit the form and what fields to include in it. If this is something
    you end up doing many times, it may be worth exploring.

  zh: 通常您也可以使用 curl 提交确认，如果您只是弄清楚如何提交表单以及需要包含哪些字段。如果您最终需要多次这样做，这可能值得探索。
