    the contents from specific ones.

    but does not modify or change content in any other way.

- en: HTTP headers are key value pairs that are sent from the server in a few different
    *origins* during a transfer. libcurl collects all headers and provides easy access
    to them for applications.

- en: A single HTTP transfer done with libcurl might consist of a series of HTTP requests
    and the **request** argument to the header API functions lets you specify which
    particular individual request you want the headers from. 0 being the first request
    and then the number increases for further redirects or when multi-state authentication
    is used. Passing in `-1` is a shortcut to the last request in the series, independently
    of the actual amount of requests used.

- en: HTTP/1 headers supports a deprecated format called *folding*, which means that
    there is a continuation line after a header, making the line folded.
  prefs: []

- en: The headers API supports folded headers and returns such contents unfolded -
    where the different parts are separated by a single whitespace character.

- en: The two header API function calls are perfectly possible to call at any time
    during a transfer, both from inside and outside of callbacks. It is however important
    to remember that the API only returns information about the state of the headers
    at the exact moment it is called, which might not be the final status if you call
    it while the transfer is still in progress.
