- en: The first line starts with `curl` and first shows the main version number of
    the tool. Then follows the platform the tool was built for within parentheses
    and the libcurl version. Those three fields are common for all curl builds.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If the curl version number has `-DEV` appended to it, it means the version is
    built straight from an in-development source code and it is not an officially
    released and blessed version.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The rest of this line contains names of third party components this build of
    curl uses, often with their individual version number next to it with a slash
    separator. Like `OpenSSL/1.1.1g` and `nghttp2/1.41.0`. This can for example tell
    you which TLS backends this curl uses.

- en: Line 1 may contain one or more TLS libraries. curl can be built to support more
    than one TLS library which then makes curl - at start-up - select which particular
    backend to use for this invocation.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If curl supports more than one TLS library like this, the ones that are *not*
    selected by default are listed within parentheses. Thus, if you do not specify
    which backend to use (with the `CURL_SSL_BACKEND` environment variable) the one
    listed without parentheses is used.

- en: This says `[unreleased]` if curl was built another way than from a release tarball,
    and as you can see above that is how Microsoft did it for Windows 10 and the curl
    project does not recommend it.
