    first.

- en: '**inode(index node)** is the data structure in the** Unix-based file system** which
    stores the metadata of the file and how and where the data of the file is stored. This
    includes information related to **file size, permissions, groups, ownership, file
    type, file size, number of links**, etc. Remember!! The inode doesn’t store the
    name of the file. file name information is always stored in the directory with
    its respective inode numbers.'

- en: Soft links are also referred to as symlinks. it is the windows equivalent of
    shortcuts. if you delete the original file,  symlinks will not work. each symlink
    has a different inode.

    file, still hard links will work.
