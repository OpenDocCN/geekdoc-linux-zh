<h1 data-number="149">HTTP/2</h1>
<p>curl supports HTTP/2 for both HTTP:// and HTTPS:// URLs assuming that curl was built with the proper prerequisites. It even defaults to using HTTP/2 when given an HTTPS URL since doing so implies no penalty and when curl is used with sites that do not support HTTP/2 the request instead negotiates HTTP/1.1.</p>
<p>With HTTP:// URLs however, the upgrade to HTTP/2 is done with an <code>Upgrade:</code> header that may cause an extra round-trip and perhaps even more troublesome, a sizable share of old servers returns a 400 response when seeing such a header.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that some (most?) servers that support HTTP/2 for <code>HTTP://</code> (which in itself is not all servers) do not acknowledge the <code>Upgrade:</code> header on POST, for example.</p>
<p>To ask a server to use HTTP/2, just:</p>
<pre><code>curl --http2 http://example.com/</code></pre>
<p>If your curl does not support HTTP/2, that command line tool returns an error saying so. Running <code>curl -V</code> shows if your version of curl supports it.</p>
<p>If you by some chance already know that your server speaks HTTP/2 (for example, within your own controlled environment where you know exactly what runs in your machines) you can shortcut the HTTP/2 negotiation with <code>--http2-prior-knowledge</code>.</p>
<section id="http__versions__http2__md-_-_-multiplexing" class="level2" data-number="149.1">
<h2 data-number="149.1">Multiplexing</h2>
<p>A primary feature in the HTTP/2 protocol, is the ability to multiplex several logical streams over the same physical connection. The curl command-line tool can take advantage of this feature when <a href="ch066.xhtml#cmdline__urls__parallel__md">doing parallel transfers</a>.</p>
