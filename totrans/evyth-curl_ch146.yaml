- en: Each HTTP request can be made authenticated. If a server or a proxy want the
    user to provide proof that they have the correct credentials to access a URL or
    perform an action, it can send an HTTP response code that informs the client that
    it needs to provide a correct HTTP authentication header in the request to be
    allowed.

- en: A server that requires authentication sends back a 401 response code and an
    associated `WWW-Authenticate:` header that lists all the authentication methods
    that the server supports.

- en: An HTTP proxy that requires authentication sends back a 407 response code and
    an associated `Proxy-Authenticate:` header that lists all the authentication methods
    that the proxy supports.

- en: It might be worth to note that most websites of today do not require HTTP authentication
    for login etc, but they instead ask users to login on webpages and then the browser
    issues a POST with the user and password etc, and then subsequently maintain cookies
    for the session.

- en: This makes curl use the default *Basic* HTTP authentication method. Yes, it
    is actually called Basic and it is truly basic. To explicitly ask for the basic
    method, use `--basic`.

- en: The Basic authentication method sends the username and password in clear text
    over the network (base64 encoded) and should be avoided for HTTP transport.

    method, curl inserts the authentication header already in the first request on
    the wire.

- en: 'If you would rather have curl first *test* if the authentication is really
    required, you can ask curl to figure that out and then automatically use the most
    safe method it knows about with `--anyauth`. This makes curl try the request unauthenticated,
    and then switch over to authentication if necessary:'
