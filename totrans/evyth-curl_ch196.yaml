- en: Many libcurl functions return a CURLcode. That is a special libcurl typedefed
    variable for error codes. It returns `CURLE_OK` (which has the value zero) if
    everything is fine and dandy and it returns a non-zero number if a problem was
    detected. There are almost one hundred `CURLcode` errors in use, and you can find
    them all in the `curl/curl.h` header file and documented in the libcurl-errors
    man page.

    function—but be aware that these errors are rarely phrased in a way that is suitable
    for anyone to expose in a UI or to an end user:'

    the `CURLOPT_ERRORBUFFER` option to point out a buffer in your program and then
    libcurl stores a related error message there before it returns an error:'
