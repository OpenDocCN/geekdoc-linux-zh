- en: In Linux, there can be multiple users (those who use/operate the system), and
    groups (a collection of users). Groups make it easy to manage users with the same
    security and access privileges. A user can be part of different groups.

- en: The `groups` command prints the names of the primary and any supplementary groups
    for each given username, or the current process if no names are given. If more
    than one name is given, the name of each user is printed before the list of that
    user’s groups and the username is separated from the group list by a colon.

    change the group database after logging in, groups will not reflect your changes
    within your existing login session. The only options are –help and –version.'
