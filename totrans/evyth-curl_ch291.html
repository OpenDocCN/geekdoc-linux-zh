<p>libcurl offers a few different APIs to do transfers; where the primary differences are the synchronous easy interface versus the non-blocking multi interface. The multi interface itself can then be further used either by using the event-driven socket interface or the normal perform interface.</p>
<p>Internally however, everything is written for the event-driven interface. Everything needs to be written in non-blocking fashion so that functions are never waiting for data in loop or similar. Unless they are the surface functions that have that expressed functionality.</p>
<p>The function <code>curl_easy_perform()</code> which performs a single transfer synchronously, is itself just a wrapper function that internally setups and uses the multi interface itself.</p>
