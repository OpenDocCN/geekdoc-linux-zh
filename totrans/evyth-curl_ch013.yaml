- en: A release in the curl project means packaging up all the source code that is
    in the master branch of the code repository, signing the package, tagging the
    point in the code repository, and then putting it up on the website for the world
    to download.

- en: It is one single source code archive for all platforms curl can run on. It is
    the one and only package for both curl and libcurl.

- en: 'We never ship any curl or libcurl *binaries* from the project with one exception:
    we host official curl binaries built for Windows users. All the other packaged
    binaries that are provided with operating systems or on other download sites are
    done by gracious volunteers outside of the project.'

- en: As of several years back, we make an effort to do our releases on an eight week
    cycle and unless some really serious and urgent problem shows up we stick to this
    schedule. We release on a Wednesday, and then again a Wednesday eight weeks later
    and so it continues. Non-stop.

    number and we update the [changelog](https://curl.se/changes.html).

- en: Every single change to the source code is committed and pushed to the source
    code repository. This repository is hosted on github.com and is using git these
    days (but has not always been this way). When building curl off the repository,
    there are a few things you need to generate and set up that sometimes cause people
    some problems or just friction. To help with that, we provide daily snapshots.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The daily snapshots are generated daily (clever naming, right?) as if a release
    had been made at that point. It produces a package of all source code and all
    files that are normally part of a release and puts it in a package and uploads
    it to [this special place](https://curl.se/snapshots/) to allow interested people
    to get the latest code to test, to experiment or whatever.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The snapshots are kept for around 20 days until deleted.
