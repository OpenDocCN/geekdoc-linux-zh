    first gut reaction should always be to run the command with the `-v / --verbose`
    option to get more information.

- en: 'When verbose mode is enabled, curl gets more talkative and explains and shows
    a lot more of its doings. It adds informational tests and prefix them with ‘*’.
    For example, let’s see what curl might say when trying a simple HTTP example (saving
    the downloaded data in the file called ‘saved’):'

    to the IP address and on which port it has connected to. The ‘(#0)’ part is which
    internal number curl has given this connection. If you try multiple URLs in the
    same command line you can see it use more connections or reuse connections, so
    the connection counter may increase or not increase depending on what curl decides
    it needs to do.

    of lines explaining how curl uses CA certs to verify the server’s certificate

    selected and more TLS details.

- en: In addition to the added information given from curl internals, the `-v` verbose
    mode also makes curl show all headers it sends and receives. For protocols without
    headers (like FTP, SMTP, POP3 and so on), we can consider commands and responses
    as headers and they thus also are shown with `-v`.

    sends and receives **compressed** headers. To display outgoing and incoming HTTP/2
    and HTTP/3 headers in a readable and understandable way, curl shows the uncompressed
    versions in a style similar to how they appear with HTTP/1.1.

    (or `--silent`) option you make curl switch off the progress meter and not output
    any error messages for when errors occur. It gets mute. It still outputs the downloaded
    data you ask it to.
