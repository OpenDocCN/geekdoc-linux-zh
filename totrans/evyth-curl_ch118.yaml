- en: MITM means Man-In-The-Middle. MITM proxies are usually deployed by companies
    in “enterprise environments” and elsewhere, where the owners of the network have
    a desire to investigate even TLS encrypted traffic.

    Authority (CA) certificate) in the client, and then the proxy terminates all TLS
    traffic from the client, impersonates the remote server and acts like a proxy.
    The proxy then sends back a generated certificate signed by the custom CA. Such
    proxy setups usually transparently capture all traffic from clients to TCP port
    443 on a remote machine. Running curl in such a network would also get its HTTPS
    traffic captured.

    TLS traffic.
