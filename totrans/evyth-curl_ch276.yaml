    struct, which provides information about the incoming WebSocket data. A WebSocket
    “frame” in this case is a part of a WebSocket fragment. It *can* be a whole fragment,
    but it might only be a piece of it. The `curl_ws_frame` contains information about
    the frame to tell you the details.'
