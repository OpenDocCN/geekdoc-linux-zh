- en: Having a secure connection to a server is not worth a lot if you cannot also
    be certain that you are communicating with the **correct** host. If we do not
    know that, we could just as well be talking with an impostor that just *appears*
    to be who we think it is.

- en: To check that it communicates with the right TLS server, curl uses a CA store
    - a set of certificates to verify the signature of the server’s certificate. All
    servers provide a certificate to the client as part of the TLS handshake and all
    public TLS-using servers have acquired that certificate from an established Certificate
    Authority.

- en: After some applied crypto magic, curl knows that the server is in fact the correct
    one that acquired that certificate for the hostname that curl used to connect
    to it. Failing to verify the server’s certificate is a TLS handshake failure and
    curl exits with an error.

- en: In rare circumstances, you may decide that you still want to communicate with
    a TLS server even if the certificate verification fails. You then accept the fact
    that your communication may be subject to Man-In-The-Middle attacks. You lower
    your guards with the `-k` or `--insecure` option.

- en: If you use curl with any other TLS backend than Schannel or Secure Transport,
    it uses a CA store provided in a separate file or directory, independently of
    the native CA store. However, for some of them you can still ask curl to instead
    prefer the native CA store using the `--ca-native` command line option. This option
    is supported with OpenSSL (and forks), wolfSSL and GnuTLS.

- en: If curl is not built to use a TLS library that is native to your platform (like
    Schannel or Secure Transport), it has to either have been built to know where
    the local CA store is, or users need to provide a path to the CA store when curl
    is invoked.

- en: You can point out a specific CA bundle to use in the TLS handshake with the
    `--cacert` command line option. That bundle needs to be in PEM format. You can
    also set the environment variable `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to the full path.
