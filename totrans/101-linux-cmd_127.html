    <h1>The <code>xeyes</code> command</h1>
    <p>Xeyes is a graphical user interface program that creates a set of eyes on the desktop that follow the movement of the mouse cursor. It seems much of a funny command, than of any useful use. Being funny is as much useful, is another aspect.</p>
    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">xeyes
</code>
    </pre>
    <h3>What is the purpose of xeyes?</h3>
    <p><code>xeyes</code> is not for fun, at least not only. The purpose of this program is to let you follow the mouse pointer which is sometimes hard to see. It is very useful on multi-headed computers, where monitors are separated by some distance, and if someone (say teacher at school) wants to present something on the screen, the others on their monitors can easily follow the mouse with <code>xeyes</code>.</p>
