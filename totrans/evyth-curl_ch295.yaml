- en: When libcurl is used for Internet transfers, it stores data in caches and state
    storage in order to do subsequent transfers faster and better.

- en: The caches are kept associated with the `CURL` or `CURLM` handles, depending
    on which libcurl API is used, easy or multi.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When libcurl resolves the IP addresses of a hostname it stores the result in
    its DNS cache (with a default life-time of 60 seconds), so that subsequent lookups
    can use the cached data immediately instead of doing the (potentially slow) resolve
    operation again. This cache exists in memory only.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Also known as the connection pool. This is where curl puts live connections
    after a transfer is complete so that a subsequent transfer might be able to use
    an already existing connection instead of having to set a new one up. When a connection
    is reused, curl avoids name lookups, TLS handshakes and more. This cache exists
    in memory only.

- en: TLS session-ID cache
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When curl uses TLS, it saves the *session-ID* in a cache. When a subsequent
    transfer needs to redo the TLS handshake with a host for which it has a cached
    session-ID, the handshake can complete faster. This cache exists in memory only.

- en: CA store cache
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When curl creates a new connection and performs a TLS handshake, it needs to
    load and parse a *CA store* to use for verifying the certificate presented by
    the remote server. The CA store cache keeps the parsed CA store in memory for
    a period of time (default is 24 hours) so that subsequent handshakes are done
    much faster by avoiding having to re-parse this potentially large data amount.
    This cache exists in memory only. Added in 7.87.0.

- en: HSTS is HTTP Strict Transport Security. HTTPS servers can inform clients that
    they want the client to connect to its hostname using only HTTPS going forward
    and not HTTP, even when `HTTP://` URLs are used. curl keeps this connection upgrade
    information in memory and can be told to load it from and save it to disk as well.

- en: '`Alt-Svc:` is an HTTP response header that informs the client about alternative
    hostnames, port numbers and protocol versions where the same service is also available.
    curl keeps this alternative service information in memory and can be told to load
    it from and save it to disk as well.'

- en: Cookies are name value pairs sent from an HTTP server to the client, meant to
    be sent back in subsequent requests that match the conditions. curl keeps all
    cookies in memory and can be told to load them from and save them to disk as well.
