    using libraries that many others use, we reinvent the same things fewer times
    and we get more reliable software as there are more people using the same code.

    one or more external libraries. They are then dependencies of curl. None of them
    are *required*, but most users want to use at least some of them.

- en: curl can be built with c-ares to be able to do asynchronous name resolution.
    Another option to enable asynchronous name resolution is to build curl with the
    threaded name resolver backend, which then instead creates a separate helper thread
    for each name resolve. c-ares does it all within the same thread.
