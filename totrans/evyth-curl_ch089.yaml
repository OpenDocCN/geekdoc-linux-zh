- en: curl allows you to ask HTTP and HTTPS servers to provide compressed versions
    of the data and then perform automatic decompression of it on arrival. In situations
    where bandwidth is more limited than CPU this helps you receive more data in a
    shorter amount of time.

- en: 'HTTP compression can be done using two different mechanisms, one which might
    be considered “The Right Way” and the other that is the way that everyone actually
    uses and is the widespread and popular way to do it. The common way to compress
    HTTP content is using the **Content-Encoding** header. You ask curl to use this
    with the `--compressed` option:'

- en: With this option enabled (and if the server supports it) it delivers the data
    in a compressed way and curl decompresses it before saving it or sending it to
    stdout. This usually means that as a user you do not really see or experience
    the compression other than possibly noticing a faster transfer.

- en: 'The `--compressed` option asks for Content-Encoding compression using one of
    the supported compression algorithms. There is also the rare **Transfer-Encoding**
    method, which is the request header that was created for this automated method
    but was never really widely adopted. You can tell curl to ask for Transfer-Encoded
    compression with `--tr-encoding`:'

- en: In theory, there is nothing that prevents you from using both in the same command
    line, although in practice, you may experience that some servers get a little
    confused when asked to compress in two different ways. It is generally safer to
    just pick one.

- en: HTTP/1.x headers cannot be compressed. HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 headers on the other
    hands are always compressed and cannot be sent uncompressed. However, as a convenience
    to users, curl always shows the headers uncompressed in a style similar to how
    they look for HTTP/1.x to make the output and look consistent.

    compression methods only work for downloads.
