- en: This is a very brief introduction to the **sed** and **awk** text processing
    utilities. We will deal with only a few basic commands here, but that will suffice
    for understanding simple sed and awk constructs within shell scripts.

- en: For all their differences, the two utilities share a similar invocation syntax,
    use [regular expressions](regexp.html#REGEXREF) , read input by default from `stdin`,
    and output to `stdout`. These are well-behaved UNIX tools, and they work together
    well. The output from one can be piped to the other, and their combined capabilities
    give shell scripts some of the power of [Perl](wrapper.html#PERLREF).

    between the utilities is that while shell scripts can easily pass arguments to
    sed, it is more cumbersome for awk (see [Example 36-5](wrapper.html#COLTOTALER)
    and [Example 28-2](ivr.html#COLTOTALER2)). |'
