- en: The wait command is a shell builtin that pauses script execution until a specific
    background process, or all running child processes, have finished.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Its primary purpose is to synchronize tasks, ensuring that a script doesn't
    continue to the next step until prerequisite background jobs are complete. A background
    process is a command that is run with an ampersand (&) at the end, which tells
    the shell to run it without waiting for it to finish.

    then use a single wait command to pause until all of them are done.
