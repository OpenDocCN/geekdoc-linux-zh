    <h1>The <code>last</code> command</h1>
    <p>This command shows you a list of all the users that have logged in and out since the creation of the <code>var/log/wtmp</code> file. There are also some parameters you can add which will show you for example when a certain user has logged in and how long he was logged in for.</p>
    <p>If you want to see the last 5 logs, just add <code>-5</code> to the command like this:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">last -5
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>And if you want to see the last 10, add <code>-10</code>.</p>
    <p>Another cool thing you can do is if you add <code>-F</code> you can see the login and logout time including the dates.</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">last -F
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>There are quite a lot of stuff you can view with this command. If you need to find out more about this command you can run:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-bash hljs bash" data-lang="bash">last --<span class="hljs-built_in">help</span>
</code>
    </pre>
