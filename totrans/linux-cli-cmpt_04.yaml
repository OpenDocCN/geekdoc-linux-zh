- en: For newbies, the sudden paradigm shift to interacting with the computer using
    just text commands can be overwhelming, especially for those accustomed to the
    graphical user interface (GUI). After regular usage, things will start to look
    systematic and you might realize that GUI is ill suited for repetitive tasks.
    With continuous use, recalling various commands will become easier. Features like
    command line history, aliases, tab-completion and shortcuts will help too.

    many functionalities cramped into a tiny screen and a plethora of multipurpose
    buttons. Command line environment is something like that, but not limited to just
    crunching numbers. From managing files to munging data, from image manipulations
    to working with video, you'll likely find a tool for almost any computing task
    you can imagine. Always remember that command line tools appeared long before
    the graphical ones did. The rich history shows its weight in the form of robust
    tools and the availability of wide variety of applications.

- en: The tab key helps you autocomplete commands, aliases, filenames and so on, depending
    on the context. If there is only one possible completion, it will be done on single
    tab press. Otherwise, you can press the tab key twice to get a list of possible
    matches (if there are any). Here's an example of completing a file path with multiple
    tab key presses at various stages. Not only does it saves time, it also helps
    to avoid typos since you are simultaneously verifying the path.

    you try pressing tab after each character. With experience, using the tab key
    for autocompletion will become a natural part of your command line usage.

    and so on. Some of these can be handled from within the terminal too, but I prefer
    GUI for such cases. I do launch some of them from the terminal, primarily for

- en: You might wonder what advantage does the command line provide for processing
    images and videos? Apart from being faster, the custom parameters (like border
    color, border size, quality percentage, etc) are automatically saved as part of
    the scripts I create. After that, I can just use a single call to the script instead
    of waiting for a GUI application to open, navigating to the required files, applying
    custom parameters, saving them after all the required processing is done, closing
    the application, etc. Also, that single script can use as many tools as needed,
    whereas with GUI you'll have to repeat such steps with different applications.
