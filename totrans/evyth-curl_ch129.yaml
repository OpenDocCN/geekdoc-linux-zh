    the servers certificate has not changed. It is *pinned*.

- en: When negotiating a TLS or SSL connection, the server sends a certificate indicating
    its identity. A public key is extracted from this certificate and if it does not
    exactly match the public key provided to this option, curl aborts the connection
    before sending or receiving any data.

- en: You tell curl a filename to read the sha256 value from, or you specify the base64
    encoded hash directly in the command line with a `sha256//` prefix. You can specify
    one or more hashes like that, separated with semicolons (;).
