- en: An HTTP proxy is a proxy that the client speaks HTTP with to get the transfer
    done. curl does by default, assume that a host you point out with `-x` or `--proxy`
    is an HTTP proxy, and unless you also specify a port number it defaults to port
    1080 (and the reason for that particular port number is purely historical).

    then reads the response from the server and then hands that back to the client.

    curl connects to the proxy instead of the remote server, and might see that it
    uses a slightly different request line.

- en: HTTPS was designed to allow and provide secure and safe end-to-end privacy from
    the client to the server (and back). In order to provide that when speaking to
    an HTTP proxy, the HTTP protocol has a special request that curl uses to setup
    a tunnel through the proxy that it then can encrypt and verify. This HTTP method
    is known as `CONNECT`.

- en: An HTTP proxy means the proxy itself speaks HTTP. HTTP proxies are primarily
    used to proxy HTTP but it is also fairly common that they support other protocols
    as well. In particular, FTP is fairly commonly supported.

- en: 'When talking FTP over an HTTP proxy, it is usually done by more or less pretending
    the other protocol works like HTTP and asking the proxy to get this URL even if
    the URL is not using HTTP. This distinction is important because it means that
    when sent over an HTTP proxy like this, curl does not really speak FTP even though
    given an FTP URL; thus FTP-specific features do not work:'

    side. That is exactly what’s done every time you use HTTPS through the HTTP proxy.

- en: When you do HTTPS through a proxy you normally connect through to the default
    HTTPS remote TCP port number 443\. Most HTTP proxies white list and allow connections
    only to hosts on that port number and perhaps a few others. Most proxies deny
    clients from connecting to just any random port (for reasons only the proxy administrators
    know).
