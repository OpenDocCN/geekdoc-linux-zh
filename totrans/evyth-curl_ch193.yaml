    are made. The release number Y is bumped when changes are performed or things/features
    are added. The patch number Z is bumped when the changes are mere bugfixes.

    big has been made, 1.3.0 if not that big changes were made or 1.2.4 if mostly
    bugs were fixed.

- en: Bumping, as in increasing the number with 1, is unconditionally only affecting
    one of the numbers (and the ones to the right of it are set to zero). 1 becomes
    2, 3 becomes 4, 9 becomes 10, 88 becomes 89 and 99 becomes 100\. So, after 1.2.9
    comes 1.2.10\. After 3.99.3, 3.100.0 might come.

    numbers and various features and in the running version of libcurl. You call it
    by giving it a special age counter so that libcurl knows the age of the libcurl
    that calls it. The age is a define called `CURLVERSION_NOW` and is a counter that
    is increased at irregular intervals throughout the curl development. The age number
    tells libcurl what struct set it can return.
