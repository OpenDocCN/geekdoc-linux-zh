    considered curl’s business. Things that are not related to that should be avoided
    and be left for other projects and products.

- en: It could be important to also consider that curl and libcurl try to avoid handling
    the actual data that is transferred. It has, for example, no knowledge about HTML
    or anything else of the content that is popular to transfer over HTTP, but it
    knows all about how to transfer such data over HTTP.

    scripts and applications for an Internet connected world, but they are also widely
    used for server testing, protocol fiddling and trying out new things.

- en: Running curl from the command line was natural and Daniel never considered anything
    else than that it would output data on stdout, to the terminal, by default. The
    “everything is a pipe” mantra of standard Unix philosophy was something Daniel
    believed in. curl is like ‘cat’ or one of the other Unix tools; it sends data
    to stdout to make it easy to chain together with other tools to do what you want.
    That is also why virtually all curl options that allow reading from a file or
    writing to a file, also have the ability to select doing it to stdout or from
    stdin.

    any question about whether curl should support multiple URLs on the command line.

    means. It does not feature any other GUI or UI other than mere text in and text

- en: While the command-line tool came first, the network engine was ripped out and
    converted into a library during the year 2000 and the concepts we still have today
    were introduced with libcurl 7.1 in August 2000\. Since then, the command line
    tool has been a thin layer of logic to make a tool around the library that does
    all the heavy lifting.

- en: libcurl is designed and meant to be available for anyone who wants to add client-side
    file transfer capabilities to their software, on any platform, any architecture
    and for any purpose. libcurl is also extremely liberally licensed to avoid that
    becoming an obstacle.

    are preferred, people have created libcurl [bindings](../bindings/) for them.
