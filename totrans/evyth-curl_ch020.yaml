    or how Internet protocols are being developed or updated.

    within the already supported protocols, and more and better APIs for libcurl to
    allow users to do transfers even better and faster.

    holding a bunch of ideas that we could work on in the future. It also keeps a
    [KNOWN_BUGS](https://curl.se/docs/knownbugs.html) document with a list of known
    problems we would like to fix.

- en: There is a [ROADMAP](https://curl.se/dev/roadmap.html) document that describes
    some plans for the short-term that some of the active developers thought they
    would work on next. Of course, we can not promise that we will always follow it.

    to get done, be it bug fixes or new features.
