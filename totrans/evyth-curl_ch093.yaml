    transfer starts. Maybe that would use too much bandwidth, take too long time or
    you do not have enough space on your hard drive:'

    can figure out the size before the transfer starts it aborts before trying to

    the transfer starts. Such transfers thus are then aborted first when they actually
    reach that limit.
