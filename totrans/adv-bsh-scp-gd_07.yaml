- en: Quoting means just that, bracketing a string in quotes. This has the effect
    of protecting [special characters](special-chars.html#SCHARLIST1) in the string
    from reinterpretation or expansion by the shell or shell script. (A character
    is "special" if it has an interpretation other than its literal meaning. For example,
    the [asterisk *](special-chars.html#ASTERISKREF) represents a *wild card* character
    in [globbing](globbingref.html) and [Regular Expressions](regexp.html#REGEXREF)).

- en: In everyday speech or writing, when we "quote" a phrase, we set it apart and
    give it special meaning. In a Bash script, when we *quote* a string, we set it
    apart and protect its *literal* meaning.

- en: Certain programs and utilities reinterpret or expand special characters in a
    quoted string. An important use of quoting is protecting a command-line parameter
    from the shell, but still letting the calling program expand it.
