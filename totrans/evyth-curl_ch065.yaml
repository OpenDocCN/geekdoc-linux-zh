- en: As mentioned above, curl supports hundreds of command-line options and it also
    supports an unlimited number of URLs. If your shell or command-line system supports
    it, there is really no limit to how long a command line you can pass to curl.

- en: curl parses the entire command line first, apply the wishes from the command-line
    options used, and then go over the URLs one by one (in a left to right order)
    to perform the operations.

- en: For some options (for example `-o` or `-O` that tell curl where to store the
    transfer), you may want to specify one option for each URL on the command line.

- en: curl returns an exit code for its operation on the last URL used. If you instead
    rather want curl to exit with an error on the first URL in the set that fails,
    use the `--fail-early` option.

- en: If you use a command-line with two URLs, you must tell curl how to handle both
    of them. The `-o` and `-O` options instruct curl how to save the output for *one*
    URL of the URLs, so you might want to have as many of those options as you have
    URLs on the command line.

- en: If you have more URLs than output options on the command line, the URL content
    without a corresponding output instruction then instead gets sent to stdout.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Using the `--remote-name-all` flag automatically makes curl act as if `-O` was
    used for all given URLs that do not have any output option.

- en: In previous sections we described how curl always parses all options in the
    whole command line and applies those to all the URLs that it transfers.
  prefs: []

- en: 'That was a simplification: curl also offers an option (`-:`, `--next`) that
    inserts a boundary between a set of options and URLs for which it applies the
    options. When the command-line parser finds a `--next` option, it applies the
    following options to the next set of URLs. The `--next` option thus works as a
    *divider* between a set of options and URLs. You can use as many `--next` options
    as you please.'
