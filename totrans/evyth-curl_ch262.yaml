    held in the handle. It means that the URL was valid as far as libcurl concerns.

- en: If the passed in string does not use a scheme, assume that the default one was
    intended. The default scheme is HTTPS. If this is not set, a URL without a scheme
    part is not accepted as valid. Overrides the `CURLU_GUESS_SCHEME` option if both
    are set.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Makes libcurl allow the URL to be set without a scheme and it instead “guesses”
    which scheme that was intended based on the hostname. If the outermost sub-domain
    name matches DICT, FTP, IMAP, LDAP, POP3 or SMTP then that scheme is used, otherwise
    it picks HTTP. Conflicts with the `CURLU_DEFAULT_SCHEME` option which takes precedence
    if both are set.

- en: Skips authority checks. The RFC allows individual schemes to omit the host part
    (normally the only mandatory part of the authority), but libcurl cannot know whether
    this is permitted for custom schemes. Specifying the flag permits empty authority
    sections, similar to how the file scheme is handled. Really only usable in combination
    with `CURLU_NON_SUPPORT_SCHEME`.

    curl otherwise removes sequences of dot-slash and dot-dot etc. The same option
    used for transfers is called `CURLOPT_PATH_AS_IS`.

- en: '`CURLU_ALLOW_SPACE`'
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Makes the URL parser allow space (ASCII 32) where possible. The URL syntax does
    normally not allow spaces anywhere, but they should be encoded as `%20` or `+`.
    When spaces are allowed, they are still not allowed in the scheme. When space
    is used and allowed in a URL, it is stored as-is unless `CURLU_URLENCODE` is also
    set, which then makes libcurl URL-encode the space before stored. This affects
    how the URL is constructed when `curl_url_get()` is subsequently used to extract
    the full URL or individual parts.
