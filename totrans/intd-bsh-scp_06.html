    <h1>Bash Comments</h1>
    <p>As with any other programming language, you can add comments to your script. Comments are used to leave yourself notes through your code.</p>
    <p>To do that in Bash, you need to add the <code>#</code> symbol at the beginning of the line. Comments will never be rendered on the screen.</p>
    <p>Here is an example of a comment:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-bash hljs bash" data-lang="bash">
        <span class="hljs-comment"># This is a comment and will not be rendered on the screen</span>
      </code>
    </pre>
    <p>Let's go ahead and add some comments to our script:</p>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-bash hljs bash" data-lang="bash"><span class="hljs-meta">#!/bin/bash
</span><span class="hljs-comment"># Ask the user for their name</span><span class="hljs-built_in">read</span> -p <span class="hljs-string">"What is your name? "</span> name

<span class="hljs-comment"># Greet the user</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Hi there <span class="hljs-variable">$name</span>"</span>
<span class="hljs-built_in">echo</span> <span class="hljs-string">"Welcome to DevDojo!"</span>
</code>
    </pre>
    <p>Comments are a great way to describe some of the more complex functionality directly in your scripts so that other people could find their way around your code with ease.</p>
