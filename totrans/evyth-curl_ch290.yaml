- en: ‘data’ is the variable name we use all over to refer to the easy handle (`struct
    Curl_easy`) for the transfer being worked on. No other name should be used for
    this and nothing else should use this name. The easy handle is the main object
    identifying a transfer. A transfer typically uses a connection at some point and
    typically only one at a time. There is a `data->conn` pointer that identifies
    the connection that is currently used by this transfer. A single connection can
    be used over time and even concurrently by several transfers (and thus easy handles)
    when multiplexed connections are used.

- en: '`result` is the usual name we use for a `CURLcode` variable to hold the return
    values from functions and if that return value is different than zero, it is an
    error and the function should clean up and return (usually passing on the same
    error code to its parent function).'
