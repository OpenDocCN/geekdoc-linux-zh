    a few years back I needed to learn shell scripting -- and what better way to do
    that than to read a good book on the subject? I was looking to buy a tutorial
    and reference covering all aspects of the subject. I was looking for a book that
    would take difficult concepts, turn them inside out, and explain them in excruciating
    detail, with well-commented examples. [[1]](#FTN.AEN21281) In fact, I was looking
    for *this very book*, or something very much like it. Unfortunately, [it didn't
    exist](biblio.html#KOCHANREF), and if I wanted it, I'd have to write it. And so,
    here we are, folks.

    the fellow was. At the sight of a book, any book -- at the library, at a bookstore,
    anywhere -- he would become totally obsessed with the idea that he could have
    written it, should have written it -- and done a better job of it to boot. He
    would thereupon rush home and proceed to do just that, write a book with the very
    same title. When he died some years later, he allegedly had several thousand books
    to his credit, probably putting even Asimov to shame. The books might not have
    been any good, who knows, but does that really matter? Here's a fellow who lived
    his dream, even if he was obsessed by it, driven by it . . . and somehow I can't
    help admiring the old coot.
