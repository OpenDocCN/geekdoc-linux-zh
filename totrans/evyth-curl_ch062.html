<h1 data-number="61">FTP type</h1>
<p>This is not a feature that is widely used.</p>
<p>URLs that identify files on FTP servers have a special feature that allows you to also tell the client (curl in this case) which file type the resource is. This is because FTP is a little special and can change mode for a transfer and thus handle the file differently than if it would use another mode.</p>
<p>You tell curl that the FTP resource is an ASCII type by appending <code>;type=A</code> to the URL. Getting the <code>foo</code> file from the root directory of <code>example.com</code> using ASCII could then be made with:</p>
<pre><code>curl &quot;ftp://example.com/foo;type=A&quot;</code></pre>
<p>And while curl defaults to binary transfers for FTP, the URL format allows you to also specify the binary type with type=I:</p>
<pre><code>curl &quot;ftp://example.com/foo;type=I&quot;</code></pre>
<p>Finally, you can tell curl that the identified resource is a directory if the type you pass is D:</p>
<pre><code>curl &quot;ftp://example.com/foo;type=D&quot;</code></pre>
<p>…this can then work as an alternative format, instead of ending the path with a trailing slash as mentioned above.</p>
