    it. That is what we do in the curl project. The copyright is the foundation on
    which the licensing works.

- en: A lot of Open Source projects are run within umbrella organizations. Such organizations
    include the GNU project, the Apache Software Foundation, a larger company that
    funds the project or similar. The curl project is not part of any such larger
    organization but is completely independent and free.

    is just an informal collection of humans, distributed across the globe, who work
    together on a software project.

- en: The curl project obeys national laws of the countries in which it works. However,
    it is a highly visible international project, downloadable and usable in effectively
    every country on earth, so some local laws could be broken when using curl. That
    is just the nature of it and if uncertain, you should check your own local situation.

    known to the author of this was a patent case in the US that insisted they had
    the rights to resumed file transfers.

- en: As a generic software component that is usable everywhere to everyone, there
    are times when libcurl—in particular—is used in nefarious or downright malicious
    ways. Examples include being used in virus and malware software. That is unfortunate
    but nothing we can prevent.
