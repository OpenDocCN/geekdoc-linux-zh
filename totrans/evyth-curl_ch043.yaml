- en: The source code for this project is written in a way that allows it to be compiled
    and built on just about any operating system and platform, with as few restraints
    and requirements as possible.

- en: If you have a 32bit (or larger) CPU architecture, if you have a C89 compliant
    compiler and if you have roughly a POSIX supporting sockets API, then you can
    most likely build curl and libcurl for your target system.

- en: For the most popular platforms, the curl project comes with build systems already
    done and prepared to allow you to easily build it yourself.

- en: There are also friendly people and organizations who put together binary packages
    of curl and libcurl and make them available for download. The different options
    are explored below.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Looking at the [curl website](https://curl.se), you can see the latest curl
    and libcurl version released from the project. That is the latest source code
    release package you can get.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you opt for a prebuilt and prepackaged version for your operating system
    or distribution of choice, you may not always find the latest version but you
    might have to either be satisfied with the latest version someone has packaged
    for your environment, or you need to build it yourself from source.

    more machine-readable format on this URL: `https://curl.se/info`.'

- en: The curl project creates source code that can be built to produce the two products
    curl and libcurl. The conversion from source code to binaries is often referred
    to as “building”. You build curl and libcurl from source.

- en: The curl project does not provide any built binaries at all — it only ships
    the source code. The binaries which can be found on the download page of the curl
    web and installed from other places on the Internet are all built and provided
    to the world by other friendly people and organizations.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The source code consists of a large number of files containing C code. Generally
    speaking, the same set of files are used to build binaries for all platforms and
    computer architectures that curl supports. curl can be built and run on a vast
    number of platforms. If you use a rare operating system yourself, chances are
    that building curl from source is the easiest or perhaps the only way to get curl.

    do not always necessarily succeed.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When release tarballs are created, a few files are generated and included in
    the final release bundle. Those generated files are not present in the git repository,
    because they are generated and there is no need to store them in git.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Of course, you can also opt to build the latest version that exists in the [git
    repository](https://github.com/curl/curl). It could however be a bit more fragile
    and probably requires slightly more attention to detail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you build curl from a git checkout, you need to generate some files yourself
    before you can build. On Linux and Unix-like systems, do this by running `autoreconf
    -fi` and on Windows, run `buildconf.bat`.

- en: On Linux and Unix-like systems
  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two distinctly different ways to build curl on Linux and other Unix-like
    systems; there is the one using [the configure script](ch043.xhtml#build__autotools__md)
    and there is [the CMake approach](ch044.xhtml#build__cmake__md).
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There are two different build environments to cater to people’s different opinions
    and tastes. The configure-based build is arguably the more mature and more encompassing
    build system and should probably be considered the default one.

- en: On Windows
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: On Windows there are at least four different ways to build. The above mentioned
    ways, [the CMake approach](ch044.xhtml#build__cmake__md) and using [configure](ch043.xhtml#build__autotools__md)
    with msys work, but the more popular and common methods are probably building
    with Microsoft’s Visual Studio compiler using either `nmake` or project files.
    See the build on [windows](ch046.xhtml#build__windows__md) section.
