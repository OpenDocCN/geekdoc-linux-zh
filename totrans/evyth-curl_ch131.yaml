- en: TLS client certificates are a way for clients to cryptographically prove to
    servers that they are truly the right peer (also sometimes known as Mutual TLS
    or mTLS). A command line that uses a client certificate specifies the certificate
    and the corresponding key, and they are then passed on the TLS handshake with
    the server.

    this and you should supposedly have gotten it from the right instance via a different
    channel previously.
