- en: When curl is built, it gets told to use a specific TLS library. That TLS library
    is the engine that provides curl with the powers to speak TLS over the wire. We
    often refer to them as different “backends” as they can be seen as different pluggable
    pieces into the curl machine. curl can be built to be able to use one or more
    of these backends.

- en: Sometimes features and behaviors differ slightly when curl is built with different
    TLS backends, but the developers work hard on making those differences as small
    and unnoticeable as possible.

- en: When curl is built with *multiple* TLS backends, it can be told which one to
    use each time it is started. It is always built to use a specific one by default
    unless one is asked for.

- en: If you invoke `curl --version` for a curl with multiple backends it mentions
    `MultiSSL` as a feature in the last line. The first line includes all the supported
    TLS backends with the non-default ones within parentheses.

    to its name.
