# Command line transfers

Previous chapters described curl concepts and something about the basic command lines. You use command-line options and you pass on URLs to work with.

In this chapter, we are going to dive deeper into doing actual transfers with curl. What the curl tool can do and how to tell curl to use these features to send or retrieve data for you. You should consider all these features as different tools that are here to help you do your file transfer tasks as conveniently as possible.
