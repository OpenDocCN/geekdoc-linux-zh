- en: HTTP cookies are key/value pairs that a client stores on the behalf of a server.
    They are sent back in subsequent requests to allow clients to keep state between
    requests. Remember that the HTTP protocol itself has no state but instead the
    client has to resend all data in subsequent requests that it wants the server
    to be aware of.

- en: Cookies are set by the server with the `Set-Cookie:` header and with each cookie
    the server sends a bunch of extra properties that need to match for the client
    to send the cookie back. Like domain name and path and perhaps most important
    for how long the cookie should live on.

- en: The expiry of a cookie is either set to a fixed time in the future (or to live
    a number of seconds) or it gets no expiry at all. A cookie without an expire time
    is called a session cookie and is meant to live during the *session* but not longer.
    A session in this aspect is typically thought to be the life time of the browser
    used to view a site. When you close the browser, you end your session. Doing HTTP
    operations with a command-line client that supports cookies begs the question
    of when a session really ends…

- en: The general concept of curl only doing the bare minimum unless you tell it differently
    makes it not acknowledge cookies by default. You need to switch on the cookie
    engine to make curl keep track of cookies it receives and then subsequently send
    them out on requests that have matching cookies.

- en: Starting off with a blank cookie store may not be desirable. Why not start off
    with cookies you stored in a previous fetch or that you otherwise acquired? The
    file format curl uses for cookies is called the Netscape cookie format because
    it was once the file format used by browsers and then you could easily tell curl
    to use the browser’s cookies.

    that set cookies. It is an inferior format but may be the only thing you have.

    cookies in its response, curl would update that cookie in its in-memory store
    but then eventually throw them all away when it exits and a subsequent invocation
    of the same input file would use the original cookie contents again.

- en: The place where cookies are stored is sometimes referred to as the cookie jar.
    When you enable the cookie engine in curl and it has received cookies, you can
    instruct curl to write down all its known cookies to a file, the cookie jar, before
    it exits. It is important to remember that curl only updates the output cookie
    jar on exit and not during its lifetime, no matter how long the handling of the
    given input takes.

- en: When curl writes cookies to this file, it saves all known cookies including
    those that are session cookies (without a given lifetime). curl itself has no
    notion of a session and it does not know when a session ends so it does not flush
    session cookies unless you tell it to.
