- en: You can list a remote FTP directory with curl by making sure the URL ends with
    a trailing slash. If the URL ends with a slash, curl presumes that it is a directory
    you want to list. If it is not actually a directory, you are likely to instead
    get an error.

- en: With FTP there is no standard syntax for the directory output that is returned
    for this sort of command that uses the standard FTP command `LIST`. The listing
    is usually humanly readable and perfectly understandable but different servers
    can return the listing using slightly different layouts.

- en: 'One way to get just a listing of all the names in a directory and thus to avoid
    the special formatting of the regular directory listings is to tell curl to `--list-only`
    (or just `-l`). curl then issues the `NLST` FTP command instead:'

- en: NLST has its own quirks though, as some FTP servers list only actual *files*
    in their response to NLST; they do not include directories and symbolic links.
