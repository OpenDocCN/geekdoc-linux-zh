- en: Windows 10 comes with the curl tool bundled with the operating system since
    version 1804\. If you have an older Windows version or just want to upgrade to
    the latest version shipped by the curl project, download the latest official curl
    release for Windows from [curl.se/windows](https://curl.se/windows/) and install
    that.
