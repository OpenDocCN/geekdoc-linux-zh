<h1 data-number="183">FTP Directory listing</h1>
<p>You can list a remote FTP directory with curl by making sure the URL ends with a trailing slash. If the URL ends with a slash, curl presumes that it is a directory you want to list. If it is not actually a directory, you are likely to instead get an error.</p>
<pre><code>curl ftp://ftp.example.com/directory/</code></pre>
<p>With FTP there is no standard syntax for the directory output that is returned for this sort of command that uses the standard FTP command <code>LIST</code>. The listing is usually humanly readable and perfectly understandable but different servers can return the listing using slightly different layouts.</p>
<p>One way to get just a listing of all the names in a directory and thus to avoid the special formatting of the regular directory listings is to tell curl to <code>--list-only</code> (or just <code>-l</code>). curl then issues the <code>NLST</code> FTP command instead:</p>
<pre><code>curl --list-only ftp://ftp.example.com/directory/</code></pre>
<p>NLST has its own quirks though, as some FTP servers list only actual <em>files</em> in their response to NLST; they do not include directories and symbolic links.</p>
