    of course, times when you want to store these downloads in nicely named local
    files.

    instruction”. Without said “storage instruction”, curl defaults to sending the
    data to stdout. If you ask for two URLs and only tell curl where to save the first
    URL, the second one is sent to stdout. Like this:'

- en: The “storage instructions” are read and handled in the same order as the download
    URLs so they do not have to be next to the URL in any way. You can round up all
    the output options first, last or interleaved with the URLs. You choose.
