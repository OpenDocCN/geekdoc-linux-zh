# Command line HTTP

In all user surveys and during all curl’s lifetime, [HTTP](ch024.xhtml#protocols__http__md) has been the most important and most frequently used protocol that curl supports. This chapter explains how to do effective HTTP transfers and general fiddling with curl.

This mostly works the same way for HTTPS, as they are really the same thing under the hood, as HTTPS is HTTP with an extra security TLS layer. See also the specific HTTPS section.
