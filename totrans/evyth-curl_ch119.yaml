- en: HTTP and SOCKS proxies can require authentication, so curl then needs to provide
    the proper credentials to the proxy to be allowed to use it. Failing to do so
    (or providing the wrong credentials) makes the proxy return HTTP responses using
    code 407.

- en: Authentication for proxies is similar to “normal” HTTP authentication. It is
    separate from the server authentication to allow clients to independently use
    both normal host authentication as well as proxy authentication.

    requires other authentication schemes (and the headers that are returned when
    you get a 407 response tells you which) and then you can ask for a specific method
    with `--proxy-digest`, `--proxy-negotiate`, `--proxy-ntlm`. The above example
    command again, but asking for NTLM auth with the proxy:'

    wants and supports and then go with that (with the possible expense of extra round-trips)
    using `--proxy-anyauth`. Asking curl to use any method the proxy wants is then
    like this:'
