- en: Most of the curl website is also available in a public git repository, although
    separate from the source code repository since it generally is not interesting
    to the same people and we can maintain a different list of people that have push
    rights, etc.

- en: The website is a custom-made setup that mostly builds static HTML files from
    a set of source files. The source files are preprocessed with what is a souped-up
    C preprocessor called [fcpp](https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/fcpp/) and a set
    of perl scripts. The man pages get converted to HTML with [roffit](https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/roffit/).
    Make sure fcpp, perl, roffit, make and curl are all in your $PATH.

- en: Once you have cloned the git repository the first time, invoke `sh bootstrap.sh`
    once to get a symlink and some initial local files setup, and then you can build
    the website locally by invoking `make` in the source root tree.

- en: Note that this does not make you a complete website mirror, as some scripts
    and files are only available on the real actual site, but should give you enough
    to let you view most HTML pages locally.

- en: The website is built in a way that makes it easy and convenient to host a local
    copy for browsing and testing changes before we push them to the official site
    in production. We then recommend you call the site `curl.local` and add that as
    an entry in your local `/etc/hosts` file. Then point the document root of your
    HTTP server to the curl-www source code root.
