- en: The main mailing list for users and developers of the curl command-line tool,
    for questions and help around curl concepts, command-line options, the protocols
    curl can speak or even related tools. We tend to move development issues or more
    advanced bug fixes discussions over to curl-library instead, since libcurl is
    the engine that drives most of curl.
