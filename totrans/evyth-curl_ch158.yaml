    it sends, but it makes it easier to send it. curl does not touch or parse the
    data that it sends, so you need to make sure it is valid JSON yourself.

    concatenate the contents from the options and send all data in one go to the server.
    Note that the concatenation is plain text based and it does not merge the JSON
    objects as per JSON.
