    `for` loops, `while` loops, and `until` loops.

    that we give. In our case, we define a variable called `user`, which would represent
    each user from the `$users` variable.

    sure that the loop will run 10 times only and would not run forever. The loop
    will complete as soon as the counter becomes 10, as this is what we''ve set as
    the condition: `while [[ $counter -le 10 ]]`.'

    current working loop whether inner or outer loop, we simply use break but if we
    are in inner loop & want to exit out of outer loop, we use break 2.

    b=5, it will break the outer loop. We can use break only instead of break 2, to
    break inner loop & see how it affects the output.
