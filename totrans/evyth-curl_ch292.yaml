- en: To facilitate non-blocking behavior all through, the curl source is full of
    state machines. Work on as much data as there is and drive the state machine to
    where it can go based on what’s available and allow the functions to continue
    from that point later on when more data arrives that then might drive the state
    machine further.

    code for each particular protocol may have its own set of state machines.

- en: One of the primary states is the main transfer “mode” the easy handle holds,
    which says if the current transfer is resolving, waiting for a resolve, connecting,
    waiting for a connect, issuing a request, doing a transfer etc (see the `CURLMstate`
    enum in `lib/multihandle.h`). Every transfer done with libcurl has an associated
    easy handle and every easy handle exercises that state machine.
