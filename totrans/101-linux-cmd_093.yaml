- en: When a shell exits (maybe while logging out of an SSH session), the HUP ('hang
    up') signal is send to all of its child processes, causing them to terminate.
    If you require a long-running process to continue after exiting shell, you'll
    need the `nohup` command. Prefixing any command with `nohup` causes the command
    to become *immune* to HUP signals. Additionally, STDIN is being ignored and all
    output gets redirected to local file `./nohup.out`.
