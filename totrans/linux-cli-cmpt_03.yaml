- en: Back in 2007, I had a rough beginning as a design engineer at a semiconductor
    company in terms of utilizing software tools. Linux command line, Vim and Perl
    were all new to me. In addition to learning about command line tools from colleagues
    and supervisors, I remember going through and making notes in a photocopied book
    (unable to recall the title now).

- en: The biggest pain points were not knowing about handy options (for example, `grep
    --color` to highlight matching portions, `find -exec` to apply commands on filtered
    files, etc) and tools (for example, `xargs` to workaround limitations of too many
    command line arguments). And then there were tools like `sed` and `awk` with intimidating
    syntax. I'm at a loss to reason out why I didn't utilize shell scripts much. I
    stuck to Perl and Vim instead of learning such handy tools. I also did not know
    about forums like [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [unix.stackexchange](https://unix.stackexchange.com/)
    until after I left my job in 2014.

    to conduct scripting course workshops for college students. From 2016 to 2018,
    I started maintaining my tutorials on Linux command line, Vim and scripting languages
    as GitHub repos. As you might guess, I then started polishing these materials
    and [published them as ebooks](https://learnbyexample.github.io/books/). This
    is an ongoing process, with **Linux Command Line Computing** being the thirteenth
    ebook.

    to intermediate level users. Plenty of examples are provided to make it easier
    to understand a particular tool and its various features. External links are provided

    kernel, an operating system kernel first released on September 17, 1991, by Linus
    Torvalds. Linux is typically packaged in a Linux distribution.

    architecture, but has since been ported to more platforms than any other operating
    system. Because of the dominance of the Linux-based Android on smartphones, Linux
    also has the largest installed base of all general-purpose operating systems.

    from a software collection that is based upon the Linux kernel and, often, a package
    management system. Linux users usually obtain their operating system by downloading
    one of the Linux distributions, which are available for a wide variety of systems
    ranging from embedded devices (for example, OpenWrt) and personal computers (for

    If you are completely new to command line usage, I''d recommend setting up a virtual
    machine. Or perhaps, a secondary computer that you are free to experiment with.
    Mistakes in command line can be more destructive compared to the graphical interface.
    For example, a single space typo can result in data loss, make your machine unusable,
    etc.'

    text commands. For example, the `cd` command helps you navigate to a particular
    directory. The `ls` command shows the contents of a directory. In a graphical
    environment, you'd use an explorer (file manager) for navigation and directory
    contents are shown by default. Some tasks can be accomplished in both CLI and
    GUI environments, while some are suitable and effective only in one of them.
