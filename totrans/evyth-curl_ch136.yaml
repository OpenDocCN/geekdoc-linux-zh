- en: There are two dominant protocols on the Internet for reading/downloading email
    from servers (at least if we do not count web based reading), and they are IMAP
    and POP3\. The former being the slightly more modern alternative. curl supports
    both.

- en: 'POP3 and IMAP can both be done over a secure connection and both can be done
    using either explicit or implicit TLS. The “explicit” method is probably the most
    common approach and it means that the client connects to the server using an insecure
    connection and *upgrades* it to TLS as it goes, using the `STARTTLS` command.
    You tell curl to attempt this with `--ssl` or if you want to *insist* on a secure
    connection you use `--ssl-reqd`. Like this:'

- en: “Implicit” SSL means that the connection gets secured already at first connect,
    which you make curl attempt by specifying a scheme in the URL that uses SSL. In
    this case either `pop3s://` or `imaps://`. For such connections, curl insists
    on connecting and negotiating a TLS connection already from the start, or it fails
    its operation.
