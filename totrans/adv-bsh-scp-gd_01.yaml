- en: The shell is a command interpreter. More than just the insulating layer between
    the operating system kernel and the user, it's also a fairly powerful programming
    language. A shell program, called a *script*, is an easy-to-use tool for building
    applications by "gluing together" system calls, tools, utilities, and compiled
    binaries. Virtually the entire repertoire of UNIX commands, utilities, and tools
    is available for invocation by a shell script. If that were not enough, internal
    shell commands, such as testing and loop constructs, lend additional power and
    flexibility to scripts. Shell scripts are especially well suited for administrative
    system tasks and other routine repetitive tasks not requiring the bells and whistles
    of a full-blown tightly structured programming language.
