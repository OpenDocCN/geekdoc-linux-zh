- en: Resuming a download means first checking the size of what is already present
    locally and then asking the server to send the rest of it so it can be appended.
    curl also allows resuming the transfer at a custom point without actually having
    anything already locally present.

- en: curl supports resumed downloads on several protocols. Tell it where to start
    the transfer with the `-C, --continue-at` option that takes either a plain numerical
    byte counter offset where to start or the string `-` that asks curl to figure
    it out itself based on what it knows. When using `-`, curl uses the destination
    filename to figure out how much data that is already present locally and ask use
    that as an offset when asking for more data from the server.
