    also known as aliases. For example, rather than typing a really long command every
    time you could just create a shortcut for it.

    check the connections to your web server quite often, so I will use the `netstat`
    command as an example.

- en: What I would usually do when I access a server that is having issues with the
    connections to port 80 or 443 is to check if there are any services listening
    on those ports and the number of connections to the ports.

    in the long run especially when you want to get that information quickly.

- en: 'To avoid that, we can create an alias, so rather than typing the whole command,
    we could just type a short command instead. For example, lets say that we wanted
    to be able to type `conn` (short for connections) and get the same information.
    All we need to do in this case is to run the following command:'

- en: Of course, you could actually write a bash script and add the script inside
    your `/usr/bin` folder, but this would not work if you don't have root or sudo
    access, whereas with aliases you can do it without the need of root access.
