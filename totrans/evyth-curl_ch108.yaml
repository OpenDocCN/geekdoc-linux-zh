    are not used. A totally idle connection can therefore not be clearly separated
    from a connection that has gone completely stale because of network or server
    issues.

- en: At the same time, lots of network equipment such as firewalls or NATs are keeping
    track of TCP connections these days, so that they can translate addresses, block
    “wrong” incoming packets, etc. These devices often count completely idle connections
    as dead after N minutes, where N varies between device to device but at times
    is as short as 10 minutes or even less.

- en: One way to help avoid a really slow connection (or an idle one) getting treated
    as dead and wrongly killed, is to make sure TCP keep alive is used. TCP keepalive
    is a feature in the TCP protocol that makes it send “ping frames” back and forth
    when it would otherwise be totally idle. It helps idle connections to detect breakage
    even when no traffic is moving over it, and helps intermediate systems not consider
    the connection dead.
