- en: Like many communities and subcultures, we have developed guidelines and rules
    of what we think is the right way to behave and how to communicate on the mailing
    lists. The [curl mailing list etiquette](https://curl.se/mail/etiquette.html)
    follows the style of traditional Open Source projects.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people send one question directly to one person. One person gets many mails,
    and there is only one person who can give you a reply. The question may be something
    that other people also want to ask. These other people have no way to read the
    reply but to ask the one person the question. The one person consequently gets
    overloaded with mail.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you really want to contact an individual and perhaps pay for his or her services,
    by all means go ahead, but if it is just another curl question, take it to a suitable
    list instead.

    the lists.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many mail programs and web archivers use information within mails to keep them
    together as threads, as collections of posts that discuss a certain subject. If
    you do not intend to reply on the same or similar subject, do not just hit reply
    on an existing mail and change the subject; create a new mail.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When replying to a message from the list, make sure that you do group reply
    or reply to all, and not just reply to the author of the single mail you reply
    to.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are actively discouraging replying back to just a single person privately.
    Keep follow-ups on discussions on the list.

- en: Use a sensible subject
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Please use a subject of the mail that makes sense and that is related to the
    contents of your mail. It makes it a lot easier to find your mail afterwards and
    it makes it easier to track mail threads and topics.

- en: Do not top-post
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you reply to a message, do not use top-posting. Top-posting is when you write
    the new text at the top of a mail and you insert the previous quoted mail conversation
    below. It forces users to read the mail in a backwards order to properly understand
    it.

  type: TYPE_PRE
- en: Apart from the screwed-up read order (especially when mixed together in a thread
    when someone responds using the mandated bottom-posting style), it also makes
    it impossible to quote only parts of the original mail.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you reply to a mail you let the mail client insert the previous mail quoted.
    Then you put the cursor on the first line of the mail and you move down through
    the mail, deleting all parts of the quotes that do not add context for your comments.
    When you want to add a comment you do so, inline, right after the quotes that
    relate to your comment. Then you continue downwards again.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When most of the quotes have been removed and you have added your own words,
    you are done.

    out. A lengthy description can be found [here](https://www.netmeister.org/news/learn2quote.html).

    A digest is a collection of mails lumped together in one single mail.

    you MUST consider if you really cannot subscribe normally instead:'

    to.
  prefs: []

    even the actual subject of the single mail you wanted to reply to.

- en: Please tell us how you solved the problem
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Many people mail questions to the list, people spend some of their time and
    make an effort in providing good answers to these questions.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If you are the one who asks, please consider responding once more in case one
    of the hints was what solved your problems. Those who write answers feel good
    to know that they provided a good answer and that you fixed the problem. Far too
    often, the person who asked the question is never heard of again, and we never
    get to know if he/she is gone because the problem was solved or perhaps because
    the problem was unsolvable.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Getting the solution posted also helps other users that experience the same
    problem(s). They get to see (possibly in the web archives) that the suggested
    fixes actually helped at least one person.
