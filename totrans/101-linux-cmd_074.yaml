- en: The `uniq` command in Linux is a command line utility that reports or filters
    out the repeated lines in a file. In simple words, `uniq` is the tool that helps
    you to detect the adjacent duplicate lines and also deletes the duplicate lines.
    It filters out the adjacent matching lines from the input file(that is required
    as an argument) and writes the filtered data to the output file .
