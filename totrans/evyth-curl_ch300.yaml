- en: The `Curl_easy` struct is the one returned to the outside in the external API
    as an opaque `CURL *`. This pointer is usually known as an easy handle in API
    documentations and examples.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Information and state that is related to the actual connection is in the `connectdata`
    struct. When a transfer is about to be made, libcurl either creates a new connection
    or re-uses an existing one. The current connectdata that is used by this handle
    is pointed out by `Curl_easy->conn`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Data and information that regard this particular single transfer is put in the
    `SingleRequest` sub-struct.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the `Curl_easy` struct is added to a multi handle, as it must be in order
    to do any transfer, the `->multi` member points to the `Curl_multi` struct it
    belongs to. The `->prev` and `->next` members are then used by the multi code
    to keep a linked list of `Curl_easy` structs that are added to that same multi
    handle. libcurl always uses multi so `->multi` points to a `Curl_multi` when a
    transfer is in progress.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '`->mstate` is the multi state of this particular `Curl_easy`. When `multi_runsingle()`
    is called, it acts on this handle according to which state it is in. The mstate
    is also what tells which sockets to return for a specific `Curl_easy` when [`curl_multi_fdset()`][12]
    is called etc.'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The libcurl source code generally use the name `data` everywhere for the local
    variable that points to the `Curl_easy` struct.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When doing multiplexed HTTP/2 transfers, each `Curl_easy` is associated with
    an individual stream, sharing the same connectdata struct. Multiplexing makes
    it even more important to keep things associated with the right thing.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: connectdata
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A general idea in libcurl is to keep connections around in a connection cache
    after they have been used in case they are used again and then re-use an existing
    one instead of creating a new one as it creates a significant performance boost.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each `connectdata` struct identifies a single physical connection to a server.
    If the connection cannot be kept alive, the connection is closed after use and
    then this struct can be removed from the cache and freed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Thus, the same `Curl_easy` can be used multiple times and each time select another
    `connectdata` struct to use for the connection. Keep this in mind, as it is then
    important to consider if options or choices are based on the connection or the
    `Curl_easy`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As a special complexity, some protocols supported by libcurl require a special
    disconnect procedure that is more than just shutting down the socket. It can involve
    sending one or more commands to the server before doing so. Since connections
    are kept in the connection cache after use, the original `Curl_easy` may no longer
    be around when the time comes to shut down a particular connection. For this purpose,
    libcurl holds a special dummy `closure_handle` `Curl_easy` in the `Curl_multi`
    struct to use when needed.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: FTP uses two TCP connections for a typical transfer but it keeps both in this
    single struct and thus can be considered a single connection for most internal
    concerns.
  prefs: []

    that points to the connectdata.

    handle with [`curl_multi_add_handle()`][13]. The start of the list is `->easyp`

- en: Each unique protocol that is supported by libcurl needs to provide at least
    one `Curl_handler` struct. It defines what the protocol is called and what functions
    the main code should call to deal with protocol specific issues. In general, there
    is a source file named `[protocol].c` in which there is a `struct Curl_handler
    Curl_handler_[protocol]` declared. In `url.c` there is then the main array with
    all individual `Curl_handler` structs pointed to from a single array which is
    scanned through when a URL is given to libcurl to work with.

    Each protocol that needs to do multiple commands or similar for do/doing needs
