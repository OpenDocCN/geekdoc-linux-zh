- en: Remember how libcurl transfers are associated with *easy handles*. Each transfer
    has such a handle and when a transfer is completed, before the handle is cleaned
    or reused for another transfer, it can be used to extract information from the
    previous operation.

- en: Your friend for doing this is called `curl_easy_getinfo()` and you tell it which
    specific information you are interested in and it returns that if it can.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you use this function, you pass in the easy handle, which information you
    want and a pointer to a variable to hold the answer. You must pass in a pointer
    to a variable of the correct type or you risk that things go side-ways. These
    information values are designed to be provided *after* the transfer is completed.
