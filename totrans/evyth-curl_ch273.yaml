- en: A libcurl application can do WebSocket using one of these two different approaches
    below.

- en: 1\. The callback approach
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can decide to use the regular [write callback](ch213.xhtml#transfers__callbacks__write__md)
    to receive incoming data, and respond to that data in or outside of the callback
    with `curl_ws_send`. Thereby treating the entire session as a form of download
    from the server.

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Within the write callback, an application can call `curl_ws_meta()` to retrieve
    information about the incoming WebSocket data.

- en: 2\. The connect-only approach
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The other way to do it, if using the write callback is not suitable, is to set
    `CURLOPT_CONNECT_ONLY` to the value `2L` and let libcurl do a transfer that only
    sets up the connection to the server, does the WebSocket upgrade and then is considered
    complete. After that *connect-only* transfer, the application can use `curl_ws_recv()`
    and `curl_ws_send()` to receive and send WebSocket data over the connection.

- en: Upgrade or die
  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Doing a transfer with a `ws://` or `wss://` URL implies that libcurl makes a
    successful upgrade to the WebSocket protocol or an error is returned. An HTTP
    200 response code which for example is considered fine in a normal HTTP transfer
    is therefor considered an error when asking for a WebSocket transfer.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If not using [raw mode](ch273.xhtml#helpers__ws__options__md), libcurl automatically
    responds with the appropriate `PONG` response for incoming `PING` frames and does
    not expose them in the API.
