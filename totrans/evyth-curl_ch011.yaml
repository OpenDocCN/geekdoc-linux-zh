    is run frequently every day on numerous platforms in order to exercise all code
    and make sure everything works as expected.

- en: Any problem can be considered a bug. A weirdly phrased wording in the manual
    that prevents you from understanding something is a bug. A surprising side effect
    of combining multiple options can be a bug—or perhaps it should be better documented?
    Perhaps the option does not do at all what you expected it to? That is a problem
    and we should fix it.

- en: This may sound easy and uncomplicated but is a fundamental truth in our and
    other projects. Just because it is an old project and has thousands of users does
    not mean the development team knows about the problem you just stumbled into.
    Maybe users have not paid attention to details as much as you have, or perhaps
    it just never triggered for anyone else.

    problem a developer needs to understand how to repeat it, and to do that they
    need to be told what set of circumstances triggered the problem.

    Tell us exactly what versions of the different components you used and take us
    step by step through what you did to arrive at the problem.

    or perhaps requests that you try out various things so the developer can narrow
    down the suspects and make sure your problem is properly located.

    closed if the developer fails to understand it, fails to reproduce it or faces
    other problems when working on it. Do not abandon your report.

- en: The curl project has a test suite that iterates over all existing test cases,
    runs each test and verifies that the outcome is correct and that no other problem
    happened, such as a memory leak or something fishy in the protocol layer.

- en: The test suite is meant to be run after you have built curl yourself. There
    are a number of volunteers who also help out by running the test suite automatically
    a few times per day to make sure the latest commits are tested. This way we discover
    the worst flaws not long after their introduction.

    subtle bugs that get through, some that are only discovered years later.

- en: Due to the nature of different systems and funny use cases on the Internet,
    eventually some of the best testing is done by users when they run the code to
    perform their own use cases.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another limiting factor with the test suite is that the test setup itself is
    less portable than curl and libcurl, so there are in fact platforms where curl
    runs fine but the test suite cannot execute at all.
