- en: When talking to an HTTP 1.1 server, you can tell curl to send the request body
    without a `Content-Length:` header upfront that specifies exactly how big the
    POST is. By insisting on curl using chunked Transfer-Encoding, curl sends the
    POST chunked piece by piece in a special style that also sends the size for each
    such chunk as it goes along.

    there was no chunked encoding, and after version 1.1 chunked encoding has been
    deprecated.
