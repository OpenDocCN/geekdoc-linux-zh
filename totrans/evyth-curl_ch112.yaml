- en: Some networks are setup to require a proxy in order for you to reach the Internet
    or perhaps that special network you are interested in. The use of proxies are
    introduced on your network by the people and management that run your network
    for policy or technical reasons.

- en: In the networking space there are a few methods for the automatic detection
    of proxies and how to connect to them, but none of those methods are truly universal
    and curl supports none of them. Furthermore, when you communicate to the outside
    world through a proxy that often means that you have to put a lot of trust on
    the proxy as it is able to see and modify all the non-secure network traffic you
    send or get through it. That trust is not easy to assume automatically.

    tab, you can learn what proxy or proxies your browser is configured to use. Chances
    are big that you should use the same one or ones when you use curl.
