- en: curl has a built-in progress meter. When curl is invoked to transfer data (either
    uploading or downloading) it can show that meter in the terminal screen to show
    how the transfer is progressing, namely the current transfer speed, how long it
    has been going on and how long it thinks it might be left until completion.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The progress meter is inhibited if curl deems that there is output going to
    the terminal, as the progress meter would interfere with that output and just
    mess up what gets displayed. A user can also forcibly switch off the progress
    meter with the `-s / --silent` option, which tells curl to hush.

- en: If you invoke curl and do not get the progress meter, make sure your output
    is directed somewhere other than the terminal.

- en: curl also features an alternative and simpler progress meter that you enable
    with `-# / --progress-bar`. As the long name implies, it instead shows the transfer
    as a progress bar.

- en: At times when curl is asked to transfer data, it cannot figure out the total
    size of the requested operation and that then subsequently makes the progress
    meter contain fewer details and it cannot, for example, make forecasts for transfer
    times, etc.
