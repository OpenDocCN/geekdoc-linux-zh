- en: CMake is an alternative build method that works on most modern platforms, including
    Windows. Using this method you first need to have cmake installed on your build
    machine, invoke cmake to generate the build files and then build. With cmake’s
    `-G` flag, you select which build system to generate files for. See `cmake --help`
    for the list of “generators” your cmake installation supports.
