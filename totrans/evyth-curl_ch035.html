<p>This is legalese that says you are allowed to change the code, redistribute the code, redistribute binaries built from the code and build proprietary code with it, without anyone requiring you to give any changes back to the project—but you may not claim that you wrote it.</p>
<p>Early on in the project we iterated over a few different other licenses before we settled on this. We started out GPL, then tried MPL and landed on this MIT derivative. We do not intend to ever change the license again.</p>
