    an error if not successful. Using the `--retry` option you can tell curl to retry
    certain failed transfers.

    retries this number of times before giving up. Setting the number to 0 makes curl
    do no retries (which is the default). Transient error means either: a timeout,
    an FTP 4xx response code or an HTTP 5xx response code.'

- en: When curl is about to retry a transfer, it first waits one second and then for
    all forthcoming retries it doubles the waiting time until it reaches 10 minutes
    which then is the delay between the rest of the retries. Using `--retry-delay`
    you can disable this exponential backoff algorithm and set your own delay between
    the attempts. With `--retry-max-time` you cap the total time allowed for retries.
    The `--max-time` option still specifies the longest time a single of these transfers
    is allowed to spend.

- en: The default retry mechanism only retries transfers for what are considered transient
    errors. Those are errors that the server itself hints and qualifies as being there
    right now but that might be gone at a later time.

- en: Sometimes you as a user know more about the situation and you can then help
    out curl to do better retries. For starters, you can tell curl to consider “connection
    refused” to be a transient error. Maybe you know that the server you communicate
    with is a flaky one or maybe you know that you sometimes try to download from
    it when it reboots or similar. You use `--retry-connrefused` for this.

- en: The most aggressive form of retry is for the cases where you **know** that the
    URL is supposed to work and you do not tolerate any failures. Using `--retry-all-errors`
    makes curl treat all transfers failures as reason for retry.
