- en: '`sed` command stands for stream editor. A stream editor is used to perform
    basic text transformations on an input stream (a file or input from a pipeline).
    For instance, it can perform lot’s of functions on files like searching, find
    and replace, insertion or deletion. While in some ways it is similar to an editor
    which permits scripted edits (such as `ed`), `sed` works by making only one pass
    over the input(s), and is consequently more efficient. But it is sed''s ability
    to filter text in a pipeline that particularly distinguishes it from other types
    of editors.'

- en: The most common use of `sed` command is for a substitution or for find and replace.
    By using sed you can edit files even without opening it, which is a much quicker
    way to find and replace something in the file. It supports basic and extended
    regular expressions that allow you to match complex patterns. Most Linux distributions
    come with GNU and `sed` is pre-installed by default.

- en: Sometimes you may want to recursively search directories for files containing
    a string and replace the string in all files. This can be done using commands
    such as find to recursively find files in the directory and piping the file names
    to `sed`. The following command will recursively search for files in the current
    working directory and pass the file names to `sed`. It will recursively search
    for files in the current working directory and pass the file names to `sed`.

    script to interpret. All remaining arguments are names of input files; if no input
    files are specified, then the standard input is read.
