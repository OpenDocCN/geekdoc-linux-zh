- en: Generally, Open Source software is software that can be freely accessed, used,
    changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open Source software
    is typically made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with
    the definition.

    all our intents and purposes, but we stick to the term Open Source in this document
    for simplicity.
