- en: We estimate that there are more than twenty billion curl installations in the
    world. It makes a good line to say but in reality we, of course, do not have any
    numbers that exact. We just estimate and guess based on observations and trends.
    It also depends on exactly what we consider “an installation”. Let’s elaborate.

- en: The curl command-line tool and the libcurl library are available for download
    for most operating systems via the curl website, they are provided via third party
    installers to a bunch and they come installed by default with even more operating
    systems. This makes counting downloads from the curl website completely inappropriate
    as a means of measurement.

- en: So, we cannot count downloads and anyone may redistribute it and nobody is forced
    to tell us they use curl. How can we figure out the numbers? How can we figure
    out the users? The answer is that we really cannot with any decent level of accuracy.

    the Internet, the occasional “about box” or license agreement mentioning curl
    or that authors ask for help and tell us about their use.

- en: The curl license says users need to repeat it somewhere, like in the documentation,
    but that is not easy for us to find in many cases and it is also not easy for
    us to do anything about should they decide not to follow the small license requirement.

    shell and batch scripts, to debug servers and to test out things. There is no

    ability to quickly and easily get client side file transfer abilities into your
    application is desirable for a lot of users, and then libcurl’s great portability
    also helps: you can write more or less the same application on a wide variety
    of platforms and you can still keep using libcurl for transfers.'

- en: The libcurl binding for PHP was one of, if not the, first bindings for libcurl
    to really catch on and get used widely. It quickly got adopted as a default way
    for PHP users to transfer data and as it has now been in that position for over
    a decade and PHP has turned out to be a fairly popular technology on the Internet
    (recent numbers indicated that something like a quarter of all sites on the Internet
    uses PHP).

    dialogues, documentation and license agreements. Of course some companies also
    just flat out tell us.
