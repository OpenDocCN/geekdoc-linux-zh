- en: Having a fixed maximum time for a curl operation can be cumbersome, especially
    if you, for example, do scripted transfers and the file sizes and transfer times
    vary a lot. A fixed timeout value then needs to be set unnecessarily high to cover
    for worst cases.

- en: As an alternative to a fixed time-out, you can tell curl to abandon the transfer
    if it gets below a certain speed and stays below that threshold for a specific
    period of time.
