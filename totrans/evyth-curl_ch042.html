<h1 data-number="41">Website</h1>
<p>Most of the curl website is also available in a public git repository, although separate from the source code repository since it generally is not interesting to the same people and we can maintain a different list of people that have push rights, etc.</p>
<p>The website git repository is available on GitHub at this URL: <a href="https://github.com/curl/curl-www">https://github.com/curl/curl-www</a> and you can clone a copy of the web code like this:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/curl/curl-www.git</code></pre>
<section id="source__web__md-_-_-building-the-web" class="level2" data-number="41.1">
<h2 data-number="41.1">Building the web</h2>
<p>The website is a custom-made setup that mostly builds static HTML files from a set of source files. The source files are preprocessed with what is a souped-up C preprocessor called <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/fcpp/">fcpp</a> and a set of perl scripts. The man pages get converted to HTML with <a href="https://daniel.haxx.se/projects/roffit/">roffit</a>. Make sure fcpp, perl, roffit, make and curl are all in your $PATH.</p>
<p>Once you have cloned the git repository the first time, invoke <code>sh bootstrap.sh</code> once to get a symlink and some initial local files setup, and then you can build the website locally by invoking <code>make</code> in the source root tree.</p>
<p>Note that this does not make you a complete website mirror, as some scripts and files are only available on the real actual site, but should give you enough to let you view most HTML pages locally.</p>

<h2 data-number="41.2">Run a local clone</h2>
<p>The website is built in a way that makes it easy and convenient to host a local copy for browsing and testing changes before we push them to the official site in production. We then recommend you call the site <code>curl.local</code> and add that as an entry in your local <code>/etc/hosts</code> file. Then point the document root of your HTTP server to the curl-www source code root.</p>
