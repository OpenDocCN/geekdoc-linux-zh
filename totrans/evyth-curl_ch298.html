<h1 data-number="297">Memory debugging</h1>
<p>The file <code>lib/memdebug.c</code> contains debug-versions of a few functions. Functions such as <code>malloc()</code>, <code>free()</code>, <code>fopen()</code>, <code>fclose()</code>, etc that somehow deal with resources that might give us problems if we leak them. The functions in the memdebug system do nothing fancy, they do their normal function and then log information about what they just did. The logged data can then be analyzed after a complete session,</p>
<p><code>memanalyze.pl</code> is the perl script present in <code>tests/</code> that analyzes a log file generated by the memory tracking system. It detects if resources are allocated but never freed and other kinds of errors related to resource management.</p>
<p>Internally, the definition of the preprocessor symbol <code>DEBUGBUILD</code> restricts code which is only compiled for debug enabled builds. The symbol <code>CURLDEBUG</code> is used to differentiate code which is <em>only</em> used for memory tracking/debugging.</p>
<p>Use <code>-DCURLDEBUG</code> when compiling to enable memory debugging, this is also switched on by running configure with <code>--enable-curldebug</code>. Use <code>-DDEBUGBUILD</code> when compiling to enable a debug build or run configure with <code>--enable-debug</code>.</p>
<p><code>curl --version</code> lists the <code>Debug</code> feature for debug enabled builds, and lists the <code>TrackMemory</code> feature for curl debug memory tracking capable builds. These features are independent and can be controlled when running the configure script. When <code>--enable-debug</code> is given both features get enabled, unless some restriction prevents memory tracking from being used.</p>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-track-down-memory-leaks" class="level2" data-number="297.1">
<h2 data-number="297.1">Track Down Memory Leaks</h2>
<p>… using the memory debug system. In general, we suggest using valgrind a the first choice.</p>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-single-threaded" class="level3" data-number="297.1.1">
<h3 data-number="297.1.1">Single-threaded</h3>
<p>Please note that this memory leak system is not adjusted to work in more than one thread. If you want/need to use it in a multi-threaded app. Please adjust accordingly.</p>
</section>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-build" class="level3" data-number="297.1.2">
<h3 data-number="297.1.2">Build</h3>
<p>Rebuild libcurl with <code>-DCURLDEBUG</code> (usually, rerunning configure with <code>--enable-debug</code> fixes this). <code>make clean</code> first, then <code>make</code> so that all files are actually rebuilt properly. It also makes sense to build libcurl with the debug option (usually <code>-g</code> to the compiler) so that debugging it gets easier if you actually do find a leak in the library.</p>
<p>This builds a library that has memory debugging enabled.</p>
</section>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-modify-your-application" class="level3" data-number="297.1.3">
<h3 data-number="297.1.3">Modify Your Application</h3>
<p>Add a line in your application code:</p>
<pre><code>curl_dbg_memdebug(&quot;dump&quot;);</code></pre>
<p>This makes the malloc debug system output a full trace of all resources using functions to the given filename. Make sure you rebuild your program and that you link with the same libcurl you built for this purpose as described above.</p>
</section>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-run-your-application" class="level3" data-number="297.1.4">
<h3 data-number="297.1.4">Run Your Application</h3>
<p>Run your program as usual. Watch the specified memory trace file grow.</p>
<p>Make your program exit and use the proper libcurl cleanup functions etc. So that all non-leaks are returned/freed properly.</p>
</section>
<section id="internals__memory-debugging__md-_-_-analyze-the-flow" class="level3" data-number="297.1.5">
<h3 data-number="297.1.5">Analyze the Flow</h3>
<p>Use the <code>tests/memanalyze.pl</code> perl script to analyze the dump file:</p>
<pre><code>$ tests/memanalyze.pl dump</code></pre>
<p>This now outputs a report on what resources that were allocated but never freed etc. This report is fine for posting to the list.</p>
<p>If this does not produce any output, no leak was detected in libcurl. Then the leak is mostly likely to be in your code.</p>
