- en: The query part of a URL is the data that is to the right of a question mark
    (`?`) but to the left of the [fragment](ch062.xhtml#cmdline__urls__fragment__md),
    which begins with a hash (`#`).

- en: The query can be any string of characters as long as they are URL encoded. It
    is a common practice to use a sequence of key/value pairs separated by ampersands
    (`&`). Like in `https://example.com/?name=daniel&tool=curl`.

- en: To help users create such query sets, properly encoded, curl offers the command
    line option `--url-query [content]`. This option adds content, usually a name
    + value pair, to the end of the query part of the provided URL.
