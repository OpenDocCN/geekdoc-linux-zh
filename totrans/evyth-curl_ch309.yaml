- en: The standard test in the suite is the “curl test”. They all invoke a curl command
    line and verifies that everything it sends, gets back and returns are exactly
    as expected. Any mismatch and the test is considered a fail and the script shows
    details about the error.

    the command line, verbatim.

- en: The `tests/log/commands.log` is handy to look at after a run, as it contains
    the full command line that was run in the test.

- en: If you want to make a test that does not invoke the curl command line tool,
    then you should consider the [libcurl tests](ch309.xhtml#internals__tests__libcurl__md)
    or [unit tests](ch310.xhtml#internals__tests__unit__md) instead.
