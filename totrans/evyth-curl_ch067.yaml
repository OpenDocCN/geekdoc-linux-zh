    makes it easy to understand exactly when each URL is fetched but it can be slow.

- en: curl offers the `-Z` (or `--parallel`) option that instead instructs curl to
    attempt to do the specified transfers in a parallel fashion. When this is enabled,
    curl performs a lot of transfers simultaneously instead of serially. It does up
    to 50 transfers at the same time by default and as soon as one of them completes,
    the next one is kicked off.

    few of them might be slow, a few fast, this can speed things up tremendously.

- en: If 50 parallel transfers is wrong for you, the `--parallel-max` option is there
    to allow you to change that amount.

- en: Naturally, the ordinary progress meter display that shows file transfer progress
    for a single transfer is not that useful for parallel transfers so when curl performs
    parallel transfers, it shows a different progress meter that displays information
    about all the current ongoing transfers in a single line.

  prefs:
  - PREF_H2
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When curl is asked to do parallel transfers, it prioritizes having the additional
    transfer reuse and multiplexing happen over pre-existing connections. This can
    potentially lower the total amount of connections (and thereby resources) necessary,
    but it might be slightly slower at start-up.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: With `--parallel-immediate`, curl is instructed to reverse the prioritization
    and instead prefer creating a new connection immediately rather than risk waiting
    a little to see if the transfer can be multiplexed on another connection.
