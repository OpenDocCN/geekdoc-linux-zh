    <h1>The <code>nohup</code> command</h1>
    <p>When a shell exits (maybe while logging out of an SSH session), the HUP ('hang up') signal is send to all of its child processes, causing them to terminate. If you require a long-running process to continue after exiting shell, you'll need the <code>nohup</code> command. Prefixing any command with <code>nohup</code> causes the command to become <em>immune</em> to HUP signals. Additionally, STDIN is being ignored and all output gets redirected to local file <code>./nohup.out</code>.</p>
    <h3>Examples:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Applying nohup to a long-running debian upgrade:</li>
    </ol>
    <pre>
      <code class="language-javascript hljs javascript" data-lang="javascript">nohup apt-<span class="hljs-keyword">get</span> -y upgrade
</code>
    </pre>
    <h3>Syntax:</h3>
    <pre>
      <code class="language- hljs " data-lang="">nohup COMMAND [ARG]...
nohup OPTION
</code>
