<h1 data-number="170">Request method</h1>
<p>The first line of an HTTP request includes the <em>method</em> - sometimes also referred to as the verb. When doing a simple GET request as this command line would do:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://example.com/file</code></pre>
<p>…the initial request line looks like this:</p>
<pre><code>GET /file HTTP/1.1</code></pre>
<p>You can tell curl to change the method into something else by using the <code>-X</code> or <code>--request</code> command-line options followed by the actual method name. You can, for example, send a <code>DELETE</code> instead of <code>GET</code> like this:</p>
<pre><code>curl http://example.com/file -X DELETE</code></pre>
<p>This command-line option only changes the text in the outgoing request, it does not change any behavior. This is particularly important if you, for example, ask curl to send a HEAD with <code>-X</code>, as HEAD is specified to send all the headers a GET response would get but <em>never</em> send a response body, even if the headers otherwise imply that one would come. So, adding <code>-X HEAD</code> to a command line that would otherwise do a GET causes curl to hang, waiting for a response body that does not come.</p>
<p>When asking curl to perform HTTP transfers, it picks the correct method based on the option so you should only rarely have to explicitly ask for it with <code>-X</code>. It should also be noted that when curl follows redirects like asked to with <code>-L</code>, the request method set with <code>-X</code> is sent even on the subsequent redirects.</p>
