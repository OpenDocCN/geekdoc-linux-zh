- en: The name ‘multi’ is for multiple, as in multiple parallel transfers, all done
    in the same single thread. The multi API is non-blocking so it can also make sense
    to use it for single transfers.

    but with the multi interface you also need a multi `CURLM *` handle created and
    use that to drive all the individual transfers. The multi handle can “hold” one
    or many easy handles:'

- en: To drive a multi interface transfer, you first need to add all the individual
    easy handles that should be transferred to the multi handle. You can add them
    to the multi handle at any point and you can remove them again whenever you like.
    Removing an easy handle from a multi handle removes the association and that particular
    transfer stops immediately.

- en: 'Having added the easy handles representing the transfers you want to perform,
    you write the transfer loop. With the multi interface, you do the looping so you
    can ask libcurl for a set of file descriptors and a timeout value and do the `select()`
    call yourself, or you can use the slightly simplified version which does that
    for us, with `curl_multi_wait`. The simplest loop could look like this: (*note
    that a real application would check return codes*)'

- en: The fourth argument to `curl_multi_wait`, set to 1000 in the example above,
    is a timeout in milliseconds. It is the longest time the function waits for any
    activity before it returns anyway. You do not want to lock up for too long before
    calling `curl_multi_perform` again as there are timeouts, progress callbacks and
    more that may lose precision if you do so.

    to wait, like if you read from your own sockets or a pipe or similar.

    during the looping. Removing a handle mid-transfer aborts that transfer.

    completes by seeing that the `transfers_running` variable decreases.

- en: It can also call `curl_multi_info_read()`, which returns a pointer to a struct
    (a “message”) if a transfer has ended and you can then find out the result of
    that transfer using that struct.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you do multiple parallel transfers, more than one transfer can of course
    complete in the same `curl_multi_perform` invocation and then you might need more
    than one call to `curl_multi_info_read` to get info about each completed transfer.
