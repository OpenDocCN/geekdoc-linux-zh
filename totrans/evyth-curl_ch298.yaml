- en: The file `lib/memdebug.c` contains debug-versions of a few functions. Functions
    such as `malloc()`, `free()`, `fopen()`, `fclose()`, etc that somehow deal with
    resources that might give us problems if we leak them. The functions in the memdebug
    system do nothing fancy, they do their normal function and then log information
    about what they just did. The logged data can then be analyzed after a complete
    session,

    file generated by the memory tracking system. It detects if resources are allocated
    but never freed and other kinds of errors related to resource management.'

    code which is only compiled for debug enabled builds. The symbol `CURLDEBUG` is
    used to differentiate code which is *only* used for memory tracking/debugging.

    on by running configure with `--enable-curldebug`. Use `-DDEBUGBUILD` when compiling
    to enable a debug build or run configure with `--enable-debug`.

    the `TrackMemory` feature for curl debug memory tracking capable builds. These
    features are independent and can be controlled when running the configure script.
    When `--enable-debug` is given both features get enabled, unless some restriction
    prevents memory tracking from being used.'

- en: Rebuild libcurl with `-DCURLDEBUG` (usually, rerunning configure with `--enable-debug`
    fixes this). `make clean` first, then `make` so that all files are actually rebuilt
    properly. It also makes sense to build libcurl with the debug option (usually
    `-g` to the compiler) so that debugging it gets easier if you actually do find
    a leak in the library.
