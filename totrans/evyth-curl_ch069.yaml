- en: At times you want to get a range of URLs that are mostly the same, with only
    a small portion of it changing between the requests. Maybe it is a numeric range
    or maybe a set of names. curl offers “globbing” as a way to specify many URLs
    like that easily.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The globbing uses the reserved symbols [] and {} for this, symbols that normally
    cannot be part of a legal URL (except for numerical IPv6 addresses but curl handles
    them fine anyway). If the globbing gets in your way, disable it with `-g, --globoff`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When using [] or {} sequences when invoked from a command line prompt, you probably
    have to put the full URL within double quotes to avoid the shell from interfering
    with it. This also goes for other characters treated special, like for example
    ‘&’, ‘?’ and ’*’.

- en: In all the globbing examples previously in this chapter we have selected to
    use the `-O / --remote-name` option, which makes curl save the target file using
    the filename part of the used URL.

    you want to save them in a different subdirectory or create the saved filenames

    - that means the single character `#` followed by the glob number which starts
    with 1 for the first glob and ends with the last glob.

  prefs:

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When the globbing concept was introduced in curl in the 1990s, we all used the
    same Internet standard for how the URL syntax was defined, and in this standard
    these four symbols are documented as *reserved*. You had to URL-encode them in
    the URL if you wanted to use them (`%HH` style). Those symbols were therefore
    not used in URLs and were downright attractive to use for globbing purposes.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Later on, the URL syntax has gradually been relaxed and changed and these days
    every now and then we see URLs used where one of the four symbols `[]{}` are used
    as-is, without being URL-encoded. Passing such a URL to curl causes it to spew
    out syntax errors when the glob parser goes crazy.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To work around that problem, you have two separate options. You either encode
    the symbols yourself, or you switch off globbing.
