  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can normally and easily do that by editing your `hosts` file (`/etc/hosts`
    on Linux and Unix-like systems) and adding, for example, `127.0.0.1 example.com`
    to redirect the host to your localhost. However this edit requires admin access
    and it has the downside that it affects all other applications at the same time.

- en: The `Host:` header is the normal way an HTTP client tells the HTTP server which
    server it speaks to, as typically an HTTP server serves many different names using
    the same software instance.

    with the contents of the site even when you did not actually connect to that hostname.

- en: The `Host:` header is not enough when communicating with an HTTPS server. With
    HTTPS there is a separate extension field in the TLS protocol called SNI (Server
    Name Indication) that lets the client tell the server the name of the server it
    wants to talk to. curl only extracts the SNI name to send from the given URL.

    a minor variation. It allows you to specify a replacement name and port number

    connect.

    turn is actually served by three different individual HTTP servers: load1, load2
    and load3, for load balancing purposes. In a typical normal procedure, curl resolves
    the main site and gets to speak to one of the load balanced servers (as it gets
    a list back and just picks one of them) and all is well. If you want to send a
    test request to one specific server out of the load balanced set (`load1.example.com`
    for example) you can instruct curl to do that.'

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As should be detailed elsewhere in this book, curl may be built with several
    different name resolving backends. One of those backends is powered by the c-ares
    library and when curl is built to use c-ares, it gets a few extra superpowers
    that curl built to use other name resolve backends do not get. Namely, it gains
    the ability to more specifically instruct what DNS servers to use and how that
    DNS traffic is using the network.

- en: With `--dns-servers`, you can specify exactly which DNS server curl should use
    instead of the default one. This lets you run your own experimental server that
    answers differently, or use a backup one if your regular one is unreliable or
    dead.

- en: With `--dns-ipv4-addr` and `--dns-ipv6-addr` you ask curl to “bind” its local
    end of the DNS communication to a specific IP address and with `--dns-interface`
    you can instruct curl to use a specific network interface to use for its DNS requests.

    what they are doing and understand what these options do. But they offer customizable
    DNS name resolution operations.
