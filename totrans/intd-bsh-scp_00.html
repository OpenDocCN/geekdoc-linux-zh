    <p>This is an open-source introduction to Bash scripting guide that will help you learn the basics of Bash scripting and start writing awesome Bash scripts that will help you automate your daily SysOps, DevOps, and Dev tasks. No matter if you are a DevOps/SysOps engineer, developer, or just a Linux enthusiast, you can use Bash scripts to combine different Linux commands and automate tedious and repetitive daily tasks so that you can focus on more productive and fun things.</p>
    <p>The guide is suitable for anyone working as a developer, system administrator, or a DevOps engineer and wants to learn the basics of Bash scripting.</p>
    <p>The first 13 chapters would be purely focused on getting some solid Bash scripting foundations, then the rest of the chapters would give you some real-life examples and scripts.</p>
    <h2>About the author</h2>
    <p>My name is Bobby Iliev, and I have been working as a Linux DevOps Engineer since 2014. I am an avid Linux lover and supporter of the open-source movement philosophy. I am always doing that which I cannot do in order that I may learn how to do it, and I believe in sharing knowledge.</p>
    <p>I think it's essential always to keep professional and surround yourself with good people, work hard, and be nice to everyone. You have to perform at a consistently higher level than others. That's the mark of a true professional.</p>
