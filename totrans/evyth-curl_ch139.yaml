- en: IPFS is the *Inter-Planetary File System*. curl supports IPFS only via an *HTTP
    gateway*. It means that it understands IPFS URLs when given to it, but you must
    also provide a working gateway URL for curl to use to retrieve the content. curl
    does not speak IPFS natively.

- en: If you opt to go for a remote gateway you should be aware that you completely
    trust the gateway. This is fine in local gateways as you host it yourself. With
    remote gateways there could potentially be a malicious actor returning you data
    that does not match the request you made, inspect or even interfere with the request.
    You might not notice this when getting IPFS using curl.

- en: If the `--ipfs-gateway` option is not used, curl checks the `IPFS_GATEWAY` environment
    variable for guidance and if not set, the `~/.ipfs/gateway` file that can be used
    to identify the gateway.
