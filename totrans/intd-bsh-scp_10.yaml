    We can now use them with standard conditional statements like `if`, `if-else`
    and `switch case` statements.

    we want to make sure that the user is neither the admin user nor the root user
    to ensure the script is incapable of causing too much damage. We'll use the `or`
    operator in this example, noted by `||`. This means that either of the conditions
    needs to be true. If we used the `and` operator of `&&` then both conditions would
    need to be true.

    complex conditionals when there are multiple different choices. So rather than
    using a few `if`, and `if-else` statements, you could use a single `case` statement.
