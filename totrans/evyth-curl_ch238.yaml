    an infinite amount of time.

    occurs. If none of those events happen, the transfer continues.

    from one of those functions the entire transfer is stopped. For example the read,
    write or progress callbacks.

- en: There is no provided function that allows your application to stop an ongoing
    `curl_easy_perform()` call from another thread. The common suggestion is then
    that you signal that intent in a private way that you can detect in a callback
    and have that callback return error when it happens.

- en: The multi interface is generally a non-blocking API, so in most situations you
    can stop a transfer by removing its corresponding easy handle from the multi handle
    using `curl_multi_remove_handle()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you use the multi API, you might call libcurl to wait for activities or
    traffic on sockets libcurl works with. A call that might sit blocking while waiting
    for something to happen (or a timeout to expire), like `curl_multi_poll()`.
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An application can make a blocked call to `curl_multi_poll()` wake up and return
    forcibly and immediately by calling `curl_multi_wakeup()` from another thread.
