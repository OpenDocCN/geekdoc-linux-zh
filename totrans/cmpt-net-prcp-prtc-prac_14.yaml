- en: A server that implements the DNS protocol and can resolve queries. A resolver
    usually serves a set of clients (e.g. all hosts in campus or all clients of a
    given ISP). It sends DNS queries to nameservers everywhere on behalf of its clients
    and stores the received answers in its cache. A resolver must know the IP addresses
    of the root nameservers.
